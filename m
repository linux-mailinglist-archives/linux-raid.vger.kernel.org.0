I agree that in general it may not be known at compile time. Thus,
I've left the default as RAID0_LAYOUT_NONE. However, there are
use-cases where it is known at compile-time which layout is needed.
In our use-case, we knew that we didn't have any pre-3.14 raid0
arrays. Thus, we can safely set RAID0_ALT_MULTIZONE_LAYOUT. So
this is a simpler configuration for us than setting module or command
line parameters.

Thanks,
