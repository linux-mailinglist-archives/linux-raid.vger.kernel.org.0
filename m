Dunno whether now is the time, but if you're moving superblocks, can we 
think about (a) moving superblocks to convert between 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2, 
and (b) possibly leaving backup copies lying around.

As I say, now might not to be the time to do it, but if you're thinking 
about it, an easy way to do it might just hit you in the face, and you 
won't leave any landmines if someone comes along later to do it.

(As maintainer of the raid wiki, backup superblocks assisting raid 
recovery might be a VERY useful tool !!!)

Cheers,
Wol
