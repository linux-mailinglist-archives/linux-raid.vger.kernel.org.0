That's why I took on updating the wiki. To try and provide an up-to-date 
reference site. Problem is, like you did, people usually find the old 
duff stuff first.

Did your example tell you to use --backup-file? If it did, I hope it 
wasn't the wiki!

If the --grow told you it needed a backup, I'd be surprised but if it 
asks for it it needs it.

Once you were trying to fix things, it would be normal for it to ask for 
the backup you originally gave it ...

That's new enough. So it's not (I hope) that problem.

Well, I don't know what the letters stand for, but the expression is a 
pretty standard term for "return to supplier". If you return anything 
that is defective, the supplier will usually ask you to "fill in an RMA".

Dare I suggest you need to read this page ...

If you haven't come across ESR he may be a bit of a nutter, but he is an 
extremely good psychologist - it is well worth reading!

I gave you a link. If you went there, the very first link in it gave you 
some advice - https://raid.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Asking_for_help

YOU DIDN'T FOLLOW IT.

One of the things it asks for is the smartctl info for your drives - ALL 
OF THEM. It'll tell you the model number of your drives. How many 
different models do you have? Are they SMR? Google the model numbers and 
see if you can find out! If you come back and say you can't make head or 
tail of what you've found, that's fine. What's not fine is if you don't try.

Okay, to throw another option into the mix, get that 12TB BarraCuda, and 
copy your data across as your main drive. You're probably better off 
with an IronWolf, but I don't know if they come as a 12TB and they'd 
cost rather more ...

Then you can combine the other drives with btrfs as a backup volume. 
That way, if the 12TB breaks you've got a backup, and if one of the 4TBs 
break, btrfs means you only lose what's on that disk (which is "backed 
up" on your live disk ...)

Sorry, I don't mean to be sarcastic, and offering to spend more money

and imho, you NEED to back up your data, which I think means spending 
money, whether you can afford it or not :-(

I personally don't have experience playing with broken arrays (unlike 
others on this list), so I don't want to advise you to do something that 
trashes your array and loses everything ...

You describe exactly how I often feel, so we do understand. And yes, 
when your raid isn't working properly I can understand the panic. Let's 
work out WHAT is wrong. I'm hoping, if your drives were purchased at 
different times, the problem might be the new drives only are SMR. If it 
looks like something I'm not happy dealing with, I can kick it up to 
people who have more experience.

Cheers,
Wol
