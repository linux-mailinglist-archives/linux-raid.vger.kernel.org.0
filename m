relieble enough for /boot and given that i run a HP microserver with the 
whole OS on a USB stick since 2016 to have only the RAID10 data on the 4 
drives....

and the initrd lives where?

i want my identical machines to stay as they are with all their UUIDs 
which is the main topic here

it's not funny when you are used to rsync your /etc/fstab over 11 years 
that doing so would lead in a unbootbale system on the other side

in a perfect world new hardware would still support 4 SATA drives and 
UEFI would be able to boot from a RAID1 like BIOS-boot does no matter 
which of the 4 drives are there and the hardware replacement would be 
insert the 4 old disks and power on

all that new crap sucks completly
