I can't say enough good things about the LSI SATA RAID controllers.
You can usually get them pretty cheap on eBay, and just flash them
with the JBOD firmware and they do great.

  LSI Logic / Symbios Logic SAS2008 PCI-Express Fusion-MPT S)

It's been a while, but I think it was an IBM branded card at the
time.  8 ports, easy setup, works well.  And looking on ebay, they're
cheap now, around $50 though you might have to pay for the 1-to-4
cables to goto SATA drives.  9211, 9341, stuff like that.  Here's an
eBay listing with cables:

https://www.ebay.com/p/1404809612?iid=133501363959&_trkparms=aid%3D555018%26algo%3DPL.SIM%26ao%3D1%26asc%3D20170810093926%26meid%3De20ed20fb9634e328a31bca5c9e2063c%26pid%3D100854%26rk%3D1%26rkt%3D1%26itm%3D133501363959%26pmt%3D1%26noa%3D0%26pg%3D2322090%26algv%3DSimplAMLSeedlessV2&_trksid=p2322090.c100854.m4779

In my mind, the other advantage of these cards is that you can get two
of them, and split your data across two controllers.  But it also gets
your data disks off the internal controllers, which means you don't
run into nearly as many problems where the system tries to boot off
your data drives, or you have to put boot blocks on them, etc.  

This controller would be more tolerant of your existing drives, since
you have the 850w power supply, it's almost certainly not power
problems either.
