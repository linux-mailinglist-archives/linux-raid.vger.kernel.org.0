Roger,

    Good point about breaking up the disk into partitions and building 
same numbered partition in to a raid volume. Do you recommend this 
procedure even if I do only raid1? I am afraid to make raid6 over 4x14TB 
disks. I want to keep rebuild simple and not thrash the disks each time 
I (have to) replace one. Even if I split into 3tb partitions, I replace 
one disk all of them will rebuild and it will be a seek festival. I am 
hoping simplicity of raid1 will be more suited when expected URE size is 
smaller than a single disk capacity. I like the +2 redundancy of raid6 
over +1 raid1 (not doing raid1 over 3 disks as I fee that is a huge waste)

Regards
Ramesh
