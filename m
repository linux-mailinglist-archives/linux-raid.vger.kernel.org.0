Good to know.

Hopefully that will improve the badblocks handling in md. Sounds like 
that could in part be the problems we've been seeing.

If I integrate dm-integrity into md, badblocks should be mutually 
exclusive with it, but because dm-integrity is both a performance and 
disk-space hit, people might well not want to enable it.
