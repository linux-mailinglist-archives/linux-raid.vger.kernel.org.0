Your lack of confidence conveyed in the above shook me a little bit
considering so much of this code is attributed to you -- I mostly got
past that, but I am a bit concerned about one aspect of the
submit_bio() change (2nd to last comment inlined below).

Can you elaborate on the "but not quite identical"? This patch is
pretty mechanical, just folding code and renaming.. but you obviously
saw subtle differences.  Likely worth callign those out precisely.

How have you tested this patch?  Seems like I should throw all the lvm
and DM tests at it.

This one is fine because submit_bio() is the exported interface that

It seems pretty aggressive to queue the bio to current->bio_list so
early. Before this patch, that didn't happen until the very end
(meaning all the negative checks of submit_bio_noacct were done before
doing the bio_list_add() due to recursion). This is my primary concern
with this patch. Is that the biggest aspect of your "not quite
identical" comment in the patch header?

In practice this will manifest as delaying the negative checks, until
returning from active submit_bio, but they will still happen.

I just don't have a handle on how important it is to do those checks
late vs early (certainly not for all submit_bio_noacct calls from
stacked drivers). Could all be fine!

This ^ submit_bio_noacct_nocheck() used to provide the late adding to
current->bio_list.

Otherwise, this patch is pretty straight-forward.

A major thing that gets lost is the implied documentation we got as
a side-effect of callers using submit_bio_noacct().  But I've screwed
up and called submit_bio() when submit_bio_noacct() needed during
development -- so there is a definite benefit in being able to not
require knowing to use submit_bio() vs submit_bio_noacct().
