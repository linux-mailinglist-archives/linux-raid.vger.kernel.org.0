And if your system is one of the ?majority? that shouldn't swap, the 
cost/benefit analysis is COMPLETELY different for swap than for main 
storage. So don't treat them the same.

And? /tmp is *explicitly* not to be trusted in the event of problems. If 
you lose a disk and it takes /tmp out, sorry. If the tmp-cleaner decides 
to do a random "rm /tmp/*" at an inconvenient moment, well, if the 
system can't handle it then whoever set the system up (or wrote the 
program) was incompetent. Sorry. It's true. (And, no, I'm not claiming 
to be a competent person :-)

And how does backup protect your data when the system crashes? You know, 
all that web-shop data that is fresh and new and arrived after the most 
recent backup 5mins ago? But that is probably irrelevant to most people :-)

(Oh, and I didn't tell o1bigtenor NOT to raid his swap. I asked him WHY 
he would want to. Maybe he has good reason. But I know him of old, and 
have good reason to suspect he's going OTT.)

You need to know what the threats are, what the mitigations are, and 
what strategies are RELEVANT. And you need different strategies for 
long-term, short-term, and immediate protection/threats.

I run xosview. Even with gentoo, and a massive tmpfs, swap in-use sits 
at 0B practically ALL the time. Why would I want to protect it? On the 
other hand, my data sits on raid-5 on top of dm-integrity - protected 
against both disk corruption and disk loss.

And then I usually forget I've got a massive disk sitting there for 
backup. Losing a hard drive doesn't cross my mind, because in pretty 
much 30 years I personally have yet to lose a disk. I know I'm lucky, 
I've recovered other people who have, but ...

As I say, different risks, different mitigations...

Cheers,
Wol
