I just tried another approach, mdadm --remove on the spares, mdadm --examin=
e on the removed spares, no superblock. Then madm --fail for one of the dri=
ves and mdadm --add for another, now spare for a few milliseconds until rec=
overy started. This runs as it should, slower than --replace, but I don't c=
are. After 12% or so, I checked with --examine-badblocks, and the same sect=
ors are popping up again. This was just a small test to see i --replace was=
 the "bad guy" here or if a full recovery would do the same. It does.
