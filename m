There are three grades of capacity that you can get:
1) ~1920 000 000 000 bytes
2) ~2000 000 000 000 bytes
3) ~2048 000 000 000 bytes

Nobody is marketing the 1st variant as "2TB", you will find "1920G" on the
packaging and datasheets instead.

2nd one should be able to replace an HDD, unless there's some smaller
discrepancy in the sizes near the 2 billion byte mark between HDDs and SSDs. A
reason to use smaller-than-whole-disk partitions for your RAID.

3rd is not a common sight in SATA SSDs (but still happens), and is nearly
universal in NVMe. Of about ten "2 TB" NVMe models I've tested, only one had
2000, *all* others were 2048. The 2000 one was Netac NV7000.
