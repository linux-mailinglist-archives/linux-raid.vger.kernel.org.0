 From the exact same batch? That's BAD news actually.

Now that disk sizes have been standardised (and the number of actual 
factories/manufacturers seriously reduced), it should be that a 1TB 
drive is a 1TB drive is a 1TB drive. Decimal, that is, not binary. So 
there *shouldn't* be any problems swapping one random drive out for another.

But if all your drives are the same make, model(, and batch), there is a 
not insignificant risk they will all share the same defects, and fail at 
the same time. It's accepted the risk is small, but it's there.

It's why my raid is composed of a Seagate Barracuda 3TB (slap wrist, 
don't use Barracudas!), 2 x 4TB Seagate Ironwolves, and 1 Toshiba 8TB N300.

Cheers,
Wol
