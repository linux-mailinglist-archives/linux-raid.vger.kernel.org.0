md-raid is not meant to protect against corruption - it protects against 
disk failure.

It just assumes that sda is correct ...

I'm pretty the certain it's the same.


When I get it working ... famous last words ... the system I'm building 
has md-raid on top of dm-integrity. So if you do get corruption, the dm 
layer should return a read error and trigger a clean-up write. And once 
that's sorted I'll be trying to integrate it into md-raid as an option.
