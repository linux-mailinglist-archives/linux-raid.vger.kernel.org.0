I'm confident this is the problem.  I've changed the service file and
the reshape now works fine for loopback devices on my system (I even
tried it on a few small partitions to make sure).

As far as I understand it, here's what happens: when mdadm is given a
reshape command on a system with systemd (and unless
MDADM_NO_SYSTEMCTL is set), instead of handling the reshape itself, it
calls (via the continue_via_systemd() function in Grow.c) "systemctl
restart mdadm-grow-continue@${device}.service" (where ${device} is the
md device base name).  This is defined via a systemd template file
distributed by mdadm, namely
/lib/systemd/system/mdadm-grow-continue@.service which itself calls
(ExecStart) "/sbin/mdadm --grow --continue /dev/%I" (where %I is,
again, the md device base name).  This does not pass a --backup-file
parameter so, when the initial call needed one, this service
immediately terminates with an error message, which is lost because
standard input/output/error are redirected to /dev/null by the service
file.  So the reshape never starts.

I think the way to fix this would be to rewrite the systemd service
file so that it first checks the existence of
/run/mdadm/backup_file-%I and, if it exists, adds it as --backup-file
parameter.  (I don't know how to do this.  For my own system I wrote a
quick fix which assumes that --backup-file will always be present,
which is just as wrong as assuming that it will always be absent.)

But I have no idea whose responsability it is to maintain this file,
or indeed where it came from.  If you know where I should bug-report,
or if you can pass the information to whoever is in charge, I'd be
grateful.

How do newer arrays get around the need for a backup file when doing a
RAID5 -> RAID6 (with N -> N+1 disks) reshape?
