Thanks Wol.

I can't really disagree with anything you've said except to mention that I 
do have a fair bit of experience (20+ years) but it's all been pretty much 
Microsoft/Windows and hardware RAID.

Like I said this device was never meant to be used for critical data - if 
nothing else this has been something of a wake-up call for us.

Unfortunately, about the only constructive advice I can give you is "live 
and learn". I made a similar massive cock-up at the start of my career, and 
I've always been excessively cautious about disks and data ever since.

What your employer needs to take away from this - and no disrespect to 
yourself - is that if they run a system that was probably supported for 
about five years, then has been running on duck tape and baling wire for a 
further ten years, DON'T give it to someone with pretty much NO sysadmin or 
computer ops experience to carry out a potentially disastrous operation like 
messing about with a raid array!

This is NOT a simple setup, and it seems clear to me that you have little 
familiarity with the basic concepts. Unfortunately, your employer was 
playing Russian Roulette, and the gun went off.

On a *personal* level, and especially if your employer wants you to continue 
looking after their systems, they need to give you an (old?) box with a 
bunch of disk drives. Go back to the raid website and look at the article 
about building a new system. Take that system they've given you, and use 
that article as a guide to build it from scratch. It's actually about the 
computer being used right now to type this message.

I use(d) gentoo as my distro. It's a great distro, but for a newbie I think 
it takes "throw them in at the deep end" to extremes. Go find Slackware and 
start with that. It's not a "hold their hands and do everything for them" 
distro, but nor is it a "here's the instructions, if they don't work for you 
then you're on your own" distro. Once you've got to grips with Slack, have a 
go at gentoo. And once you've managed to get gentoo working, you should have 
a pretty decent grasp of what's going "under the bonnet". CentOS/RedHat/SLES 
should be a breeze after that.

Cheers,
Wol
