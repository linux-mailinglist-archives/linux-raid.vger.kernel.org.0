Yes there is already. Every time when I post the reviewed patches to =
you, there is a branch for all the patches. For example currently the =
branches in mdadm-CI tree,
  remotes/origin/20220315-testing
  remotes/origin/20220406-testing
  remotes/origin/20220719-testing
  remotes/origin/for-jes/20220402
  remotes/origin/for-jes/20220620
  remotes/origin/for-jes/20220728
  remotes/origin/master

All the branches in for-jes/ are the patches I posted to you as email =
thread. You may take any one for your convenience. And the latest branch =
will be rebased against the latest mdadm tree before I post the remind =
email to you.

BTW, the mdadm-CI tree can be found from =
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/colyli/mdadm.git

Thanks.
