HOLY...=C2=A0 I GOT IT!=C2=A0 WOW.

I guess all I needed to do was abandon hope.

The magic spell that worked (sorry, I know it's not magic to the developers=
 on this list, but it definitely feels that way to me right now):

mdadm --create /dev/md0 --level=3D5 --chunk=3D512K --data-offset=3D262144s =
--raid-devices=3D5 /dev/sde /dev/sdf /dev/sdg /dev/sda /dev/sdb --assume-cl=
ean --readonly

I'm copying the stuff I thought I lost now, while it's still accessible in =
RO mode!

The previous command I tried swapped sdb and sda, and I got a different err=
or when I tried to mount it.=C2=A0 The previous attempts all gave me the "b=
ad superblock" error upon mount attempt, but that attempt said something li=
ke filesystem errors.=C2=A0 So I made a note of it, then tried the one abov=
e, and it mounted cleanly.=C2=A0 No concerns at all.

(Sorry, I'm sure this is normally a very stoic list, but, I'm sure you unde=
rstand my excitement here.)

I assume, once I'm comfortable with my backups, I can unmount it, stop it, =
then use mdadm --assemble to load it again with read/write access. I've alr=
eady updated the mdadm.conf with the new uuid, so I think it should work au=
tomatically then.

Yes, I will review my backup plan and make improvements.=C2=A0 The plan was=
 good, in that I wasn't going to lose most of the critical stuff, but not g=
reat, in that I was going to lose some.

(And, yes, I still wonder why it happened in the first place, so I will kee=
p that in mind.=C2=A0 My guess is that if the array survives the next reboo=
t, it'll probably be fine for a long time.=C2=A0 If it doesn't, then it's c=
learly something in the motherboard trashing it.=C2=A0 Not great, but at le=
ast now I'll know how to resurrect it when I swap in the previous motherboa=
rd.)

THANK YOU EVERYONE!

Thanks.

I'm not following all of what you're saying, and I suspect I'm beyond the p=
oint where it's going to help.=C2=A0 I tried the instructions on the page y=
ou linked, but I haven't hit the right combination of parameters and drive =
order to get a valid ext4 partition.=C2=A0 Sigh.=C2=A0 I will admit I could=
n't get the overlay working, and figuring I was already likely not going to=
 be able to recreate it, I went for it directly on the drives - still using=
 readonly and assume clean, but of course it overwrites what was left of th=
e partition tables - which I figured was no big loss at this point.=C2=A0 I=
t didn't sound like my chances of recovery were very high anyway.

Basically I'm trying variations on this command - removing offset, using sd=
[x] instead of sd[x]1, changing the order of a and b, etc.=C2=A0 Would it b=
e critical the spare drive be included?=C2=A0 I can't see why it would, so =
I've been ignoring it during these tests.=C2=A0 (The chunk and offset came =
from the info on the spare drive.)

mdadm --create /dev/md0 --level=3D5 --chunk=3D512K --data-offset=3D262144s =
--raid-devices=3D5 /dev/sda1 /dev/sdb1 /dev/sde1 /dev/sdf1 /dev/sdg1 --assu=
me-clean --readonly

I really do wish I knew what happened to these drives (and I'm sure this gr=
oup would, too).=C2=A0 I'm pretty sure it was something in the BIOS that ca=
used it; I've seen a few reports of motherboards from this era (~2015) with=
 bugs in UEFI in other brands that caused issues like this, but I couldn't =
find anything specific to ASUS.=C2=A0 Someone mentioned the possibility of =
something happening while it was running that would have cropped up when I =
rebooted (even on the old board), but it hadn't been that long since my pre=
vious reboot (~30 days IIRC), and as I mentioned I've had no cause to modif=
y anything related to the system, aside from updating the software using ap=
t.

After I recreate the array, I'll throw some data on it, and then reboot the=
 computer to see what happens.=C2=A0 It'll probably be fine, but if it's mu=
nged again...well...that will certainly be an interesting outcome, to say t=
he least.

Thanks for the suggestions, everyone.=C2=A0 I'm not planning to overwrite t=
he array right this moment, so if you have other suggestions on things to t=
ry, I'm open to them.

Other thoughts as I process this:

I dunno.=C2=A0 At one point a few weeks ago, my /var partition (which isn't=
 on the array) filled up, so that caused some weird issues with various thi=
ngs until I figured out what was going on.=C2=A0 I doubt that was a factor =
here, and the array was working just fine after the cleanup.

I do have backups of most of the stuff that was on the array - I will lose =
a bunch of our ripped DVDs and Blu-Rays, which is a headache to recreate, b=
ut not truly lost.=C2=A0 I believe I have copies of all of our recent pictu=
res on my laptop or desktop machine; older stuff is stored on Amazon Glacie=
r, if needed, but I think I have a local copy of most of it.=C2=A0=C2=A0

I see a few groups of pictures I may have lost completely.=C2=A0 They were =
too new for being uploaded to Glacier, but too old to still be on my deskto=
p or laptop.=C2=A0 I don't seem to have posted them online, either.=C2=A0 (=
I'm checking my Glacier inventory now to see if I did upload them at some p=
oint, but it's unlikely.)

I did lose some data for a hobby project, which is not at all critical or i=
mportant in the grand scheme of things, but it is a bummer.=C2=A0 I've even=
 been thinking about how I should back up that data.=C2=A0 Fortunately, I a=
lways enter the most important information into a database when new data ca=
me in, so I at least have that.

I used to have a script that backed up the array to a 3TB drive in my deskt=
op machine, but as 7TB (used space in the array) is greater than 3TB, there=
 was an obvious issue developing, so I stopped it a few years back, instead=
 of paring down the stuff copied over.=C2=A0 Dang.

Thanks.

looking further gpt may simply clear all it could use.

So you may need to look at the first 16k and clear on the overlay that
16k before the test.
