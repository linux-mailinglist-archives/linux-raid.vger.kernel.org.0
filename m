I re-did these tests this morning, since I was unsure if I could have made =
some mistake last night - I was tired. There results were about the same - =
complete data loss.

As for curiousity, I also tried to skip the expand phase after creating the=
 initial raid5 on top of the raid1. After creating it, I stopped it and rec=
reated the old raid1 with --assume-clean. This worked well - no errors from=
 mount or fsck.

So I guess it was the mdadm --grow --raid-devices=3D4 that was the final na=
il in the coffin.

I just hope you find a way to backup your files next time. I'm quite sure w=
e've all been there - thought we were smart enough or something and the shi=
t hit the fan and no - we weren't.

Vennlig hilsen
