Nah, the directory I am copying has nothing really large, and the target directory is created new.

Just in case there is an issue, I will copy another directory as a test.
[later] Same issue. This time the files were Pictures, 1-3MB each, so it went faster (but not as fast as the array can sustain).
After a few minutes (9GB copied) it took a long pause and a second kworker started. This one gone after I killed the copy.

However, this same content was copied from an external USB disk (NOT to the array) without a problem.

Enough  room:
	/dev/md127       55T   45T  9.8T  83% /data1

I still suspect an issue with the array after it was recovered.

A replated issue is that there is a constant rate of writes to the array (iostat says) at about 5KB/s
when there is no activity on this fs. In the past I saw zero read/write in iostat in this situation.

Is there some background md process? Can it be hurried to completion?
