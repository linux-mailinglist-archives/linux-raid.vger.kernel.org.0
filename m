At least I know mdadm uses this sysfs interface for md raid component 
disks monitoring. It has been in mdadm for around 5 years.

Yes you are right, let it be for existing sysfs interface to avoid 
breaking things.

Now I am sure you are very probably not willing to accept the patches, 
even I know how to do that :-)

OK, then I leave the existing things as what they are, avoid to make
