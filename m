I do not subscribe to this point of view. Distributions used to handle 
multiple boot sectors, why could they not handle multiple EFI partitions 
as well ?

yum and apt are package managers, not system managers. FWIW, Ubuntu's 
grub-efi packages can deal with multiple EFI partitions in the same way 
grub-pc can deal with multiple boot sectors.

No, these are not adequate places. Too early or too late. The right 
place is when anything is written to the EFI partition.
