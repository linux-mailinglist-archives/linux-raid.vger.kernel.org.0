That's exactly what I was thinking. But I was thinking if it had been 
damaged rather than destroyed maybe stuff would have been recoverable.

That's what I missed. I forgot my array was on top of dm-integrity, so 
although I think of it as sda4, sdb1, sdc4, they each in fact have an 
extra layer between them and the raid.

Dunno what or why, but my systemd service that fires that up failed. 
status tells me it was killed after 2msec.

So if that wasn't running, the integrity devices weren't there, and 
mdadm couldn't start the array.

Oh well, the good thing is that backup drive is on its way. I'm planning 
to put plain lvm on it, and write a bunch of services that create backup 
volumes then do a overwrite-in-place rsync. So as I keep advising 
people, it does an incremental backup, but the COW volumes mean I have 
full backups.

Cheers,
Wol
