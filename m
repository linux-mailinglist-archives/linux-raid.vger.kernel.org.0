Good morning Jason,

Good report.  Comments inline.

Ugh.  You don't have to use a backup file unless mdadm tells you too. 
Now you are stuck with it.

You have to specify the backup file on assembly if a reshape using one 
was interrupted.

Using --force is very low risk on assembly.  I would try it (without 
overlays, and with backup file specified) before you do anything else. 
Odds of success are high.

Also try the flags to treat the backup file as garbage if its contents 
don't match what mdadm expects.

Report back here after the above.

[details trimmed]

Your report of the details was excellent.  Thanks for helping us help you.
