It's a little odd but not entirely absurd indeed.  But it can also
be easily handled by setting up a dm-crypt table just for the
partition table.

And that's exactly the case I worry about.  The file system can't
trust a layer entirely above it.  If we want to be able to have a
space pool between a file systems with one encryption policy and
images with another we'll need to replace the loop driver with a 
block driver taking blocks from the file system space pool.  Which
might be a good idea for various other reasons.

On the one hand they are not.  On the other if you have a file system
encryption scheme that is bypassed by a random other loadable code
setting a single flag I would not consider it very trust worth or in
fact actively dangerous.

But getting rid of loopback devices.
