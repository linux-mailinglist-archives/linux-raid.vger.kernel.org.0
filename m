Hi Song,

thanks for getting back.

Unfortunately it's still happening, even when using a NVMe partition =
directly. It just took a long 3 weeks to happen. So discard my patch. =
Here how it went down yesterday:

- process md4_raid6 is running with 100% CPU utilization, all I/O to the =
array is blocked
- no disk activity on the physical drives
- soft reboot doesn't work, as md4_raid6 blocks, so hard reset is needed
- when booting to rescue mode, it tries to assemble the array and shows =
the same issue of 100% CPU utilization. Also can't reboot.
- when manually assembling it *with* the journal drive, it will read a =
few GB from the journal device and then get stuck at 100% CPU =
utilization again without any disk activity.

Solution in the end was to avoid assembling the array on reboot, then =
assemble it *without* the existing journal and add an empty journal =
drive later. This lead to some data loss and a full resync.

I'm currently moving all data off this machine and will repave it. Then =
see if that changes anything.

My main OS is CentOS 8 and the rescue system was Debian. Both showed a =
similar issue. This must be connected to the journal drive somehow.

My journal drive is a partition on an NVMe with ~180GB in size.

Thanks for any pointers, I could try next.
