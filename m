I think that it is not necessary anymore. This is default behavior,
at least for IMSM/external.
If we are using assemble with --scan then it is probably done
manually. Do we should care about unstable connections?

Normally, udev calls mdadm -I on each drive.
There is also a timer which calls #mdadm -R on array
after timeout.

I would consider to drop --no-degraded support and adapt
assemble behavior if is different.
Neil, Jes could you look?

Thanks,
Mariusz
