Dear Xiaosong, dear Tsinghua,

Sorry for the late reply, and thank you for wanting to upstream the driver.

Is there a chance to integrate it into the current driver, and then 
choose it, when creating the RAID?

Is your code in some public git branch to be looked at already?

Otherwise, I believe just posting the patch train with `git send-email` 
and a cover letter, might be the best first step, so the developers can 
comment early before you put too much time into refactoring.

Some easy to reproduce test scripts to verify the performance benefits 
would indeed be nice, but I do not know, if that can be integrated into 
some Linux kernel test infrastructure already.


Kind regards,

Paul
