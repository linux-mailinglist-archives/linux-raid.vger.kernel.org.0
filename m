We've been seriously considering switching from raid10 to lvm stripes across raid1 for a different reason.

Crucial/Micron SSDs, even the enterprise ones, do not always finish smart tests under some read loads. With RAID1 we could set them temporarily to
write-mostly so that they can finish their smart tests and vendor tests. It would be really nice if with RAID10 we could also set drives to write-mostly.
