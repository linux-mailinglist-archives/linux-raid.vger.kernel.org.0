your common sense told me you can change RAID10 to RAID1 because it's 
only a metadata change not long ago

your same common sense told me years ago the "writemostly" on RAID10 
don't work as in RAID1 because RAID10 on mdraid is not the same as 
mirrored RAID0 but the same common sense pretended a few weaks ago the 
opposite

so your common sense is incompatible with my common sense and yours is 
based on assumptions while mine don#t need foreign assumptions and 
guessings because it can do them alone

in other words: keep your assumptions for your own and respond only to 
things you *know* and you have done in real life
