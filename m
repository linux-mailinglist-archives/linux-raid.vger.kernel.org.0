Hi Kuai.

> problem

I've had to do some sleuthing to figure out who was doing that array
access, I was already running a minimal FedoraCore image. I've
discovered that the culprit is the systemd-udevd daemon. I do not know
why it accesses the array but if I stop it and rename that executable
(it gets started automatically when the array is assembled) then the
reshape continues.

Now it is just a matter of time until the reshape is finished and I
can discover just how much data I still have :)

Thank you all for your help, I will send a last mail when I know more.

Best regards,

      Johan
