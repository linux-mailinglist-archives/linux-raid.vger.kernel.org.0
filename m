Hi pg,

I'm sorry to wake up this thread again, but I actually thought it was a very interesting idea:

I'm new here, but I'm giving up on hardware raid because I think the idea is obsolete. But I 
read your mail above:

what if the GPU could be used for verifying raid 5/6 in realtime? something like verifyread ...
the "real" parity calculation should still be done by the CPU for reliability, but at least the 
GPU can signal something may be wrong.
with nvme drives pushing 4-5GiB/s these days, a raid 6 of 10 nvme drives could easily outperform 
a single CPU core.
for raid 5, I doubt anyone will benefit from it, as it's a simple XOR calculation, but might it 
be for raid 6

For your concern about the read/write on the system bus, I agree: as with every situation, it 
will depend on the config, but it is unlikely it will never be a problem.

Your BBU remark is also interesting to me: why would data be "gone" at a power off?

kind regards,

Janpieter Sollie
