To me this looks like your problem:

FYI there's no overlap between the drives in the raid1 (sda, sdk, sdj) and the drives in the raid5 and raid6.

According to lsdrv sda, sdk, sdj, and sdl are all on the on-board SATA controller. If you've never seen an error on sdl despite it being in the raid6 
then I'd pin the blame on the SAS2008 card. You should probably start by checking the firmware version and making sure it's up to date. If it is up to 
date then try looking for bugs and updates related to the mpt3sas driver.
