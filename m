This could be.
There is some cache tuning in the folder:

/sys/class/block/mdXXX/md/stripe_cache_*

Two files, check for detailed docs.

It might help, or not.

So, don't trim.

Apart that, "Write Zeroes Not Supported" is new to me.
I guess it is always possible to write zeroes...
I know about "Return Zeroes After Trim" or similar.

It is implemented if 1) the SSD support RZAT or DRAT and
2) it is enable (under user responsability).
At least for RAID5, but it seems to me RAID6 as well.
The module parameter: devices_handle_discard_safely
Also in this case, check for detailed docs.

It's not clear to me the connection you see
between "trim" and "write speed" in RAID6.

I mean, if the SSDs have speed problems due to
missing trims, then maybe better to change SSDs.
On the other hand, as wrote at the beginning,
maybe playing with the RAID stripe cache could
help more (or not, as wrote).

Hope this helps a bit,

bye,
