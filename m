My point was that UEFI did not change the fact that "you cannot have 
everything needed for boot on a RAID", so nothing new here.

What is written in the EFI partition on kernel update in Fedora ? In 
Debian, the EFI partition is written only on grub package update or when 
running grub-install.

Not my point. My point is that if secondary EFI partitions are updated 
only during the boot sequence then they will be out of sync at the next 
boot following an update of the primary EFI partition.
