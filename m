Hi Tony, 

your examine output of the one drive that was left showed Device role 1,  
and count starts from 0 so that's the 2nd drive in the array. The order 
of the others is unknown so yes, unless you are able to derive order 
from raw data, you simply have to try all combinations. This can be 
scripted as well.

Furthermore you should --examine the array you created and make sure 
that all other variables (offset, level, layout, ...), match your 
previous --examine.

As for re-creating overlays, you can do that for every single step 
but it might not be necessary just for mount attempt.

Note that there is the case where mounting might succeed but drive 
order is still wrong - find a large file and see if it is fully intact.

Best of luck,
Andreas Klauer
