Hi Bruce,
I can say that at least IMSM test are maintained and used regularly.
You can use this subgroup. I can also see some test
improvements submitted last time in mdadm repository, so I can assume
that there are some usages outside IMSM (at least for 1.x metadata).

Without continuous integration testing in upstream it is externally hard
to have all tests in good shape. The verification is done by users, as
you can see it is not used frequently. I'm closer to say that this part
in not maintained. You can take a challenge and fix them :)

Thanks,
Mariusz
