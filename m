Roger, et al --

...and then Roger Heflin said...

% The re-add will only work if the array has bitmaps.  For quick disk

Ahhhhh...  Good point.

It didn't really take 9 hours; a few minutes later it was up to 60+
hours, and then it dropped to a couple of hours and was done the next
time I looked.  I also forced the other array using just the last two
drives and saw everything happy, so I then added the "first" drive and
now it's all happy as well.  Woo hoo.


% hiccups the re-add is nice because instead of 9 hours, often it
% finishes in only a few minutes assuming the disk has not been out of
% the array for long.

I love the idea.  I've been reading up, and in addition to questions of
what size bitmap I need for my sizes

  diskfarm:~ # df -kh /mnt/4Traid5md/ /mnt/750Graid5md/
  Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
  /dev/md0p1       11T   11T  309G  98% /mnt/4Traid5md
  /dev/md127p1    1.4T  1.4T   14G 100% /mnt/750Graid5md

and how to tell it (or *if* I tell it; that still isn't clear) there's
also the question of whether or not xfs

  diskfarm:~ # grep /mnt/ssd /etc/fstab
  LABEL=diskfarm-ssd      /mnt/ssd        xfs     defaults        0  0

will work for my bitmap files target, since all I see is that it must be
an ext2 or ext3 (not ext4? old news?) device.

Anyway, thanks again for the sanity checks and pointers.  It's good to be
whole again :-)  I look forward to the day when I can dig into growing to
more larger disks and have to contemplate reshaping from RAID5 to RAID6 :-)
