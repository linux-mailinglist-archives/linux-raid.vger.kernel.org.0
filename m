I am probably going to get corrected on some if not all of this, but =

1. NVMe is stupid fast, you need a good chunk of CPU performance to max =
it out.
2. Most block IO in the kernel is limited in terms of threading, it may =
even be essentially single threaded. (This is where I will get =
corrected)
3. AFAICT, this includes mdraid, there=E2=80=99s a single thread per =
RAID device handling all the RAID calculations. (mdX_raid6)

What I did to get IOPs up in a system with 24 NVMe, split up into 12 per =
NUMA domain.
1. Create 8 partitions on each drive (this may be overkill, I just =
started here for some reason)
2. Create 8 RAID6 arrays with 1 partition per drive.
3. Use LVM to create a single striped logical volume over all 8 RAID =
volumes. RAID 0+6 as it were.

You now have an LVM thread that is basically doing nothing more than =
chunking the data as it comes in, then, sending the chunks to 8 separate =
RAID devices, each with their own threads, buffers, queues etc, all of =
which can be spread over more cores.

I saw a significant (for me, significant is >20%) increase in IOPs doing =
this.=20

You still have RAID6 protection, but you might want to write a couple of =
scripts to help you manage the arrays, because a single failed drive now =
needs to be removed from 8 RAID volumes.=20

There=E2=80=99s not a lot of capacity lost doing this, pretty sure I =
lost less than 100MB to the partitions and the RAID overhead.

You would never consider this on spinning disk of course, way to slow =
and you=E2=80=99re just going to make it slower, NVMe as you noticed has =
the IOPs to spare, so I=E2=80=99m pretty sure it=E2=80=99s just that =
we=E2=80=99re not able to get the data to it fast enough.
