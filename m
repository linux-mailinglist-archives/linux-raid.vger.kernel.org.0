Dear Mariusz,


Thank for bringing this topic up for discussion. Unfortunately, I have 
to reply with negative comments.

Improved testing sounds good. Thank you. I do not think though, that 
using GitHub is a requirement for that, and there are a lot of bots on 
the Linux kernel mailing list doing this without GitHub.

In my experience, using GitHub for code review is far inferior to using 
mailing lists or Gerrit. First, you cannot comment on the commit 
message. As a result, projects using GitHub have a really low-quality 
git history. Also, you only cannot comment single parts of a line in the 
diff.

The “one thread” discussion model is also a pain, as most people using 
Web forms do not correctly cite and quote, and with more than three 
answers you loose the overview. For some reason people think more about 
their reply, using mailing lists than Web forms.

Using different forums for discussions should also not be allowed. 
People should just subscribe and monitor one forum.

So, I strongly oppose this move, but I am also aware, that I am not 
doing a lot of development contribution.


Kind regards,

Paul
