This is correct.
It is not true to say "the array will be in a degraded state as it
rebuilds onto the new disk" as Paul did above.
During the rebuild the array will be in 2 parts:
 - a non-degraded raid5 which starts small and grows
 - a non-degraded raid1 which starts large and shrinks.

at no point in time is the array without full redundancy (unless a
device fails of course).
