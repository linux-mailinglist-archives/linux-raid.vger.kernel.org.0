Note that I have seen reports (I'm not sure where or how true they are), 
that even when requests are sent as 512k or whatever, certain upper 
layers break them into 4k's, presumably expecting lower layers to merge 
them again.

You might have better luck looking for and suppressing the breaking up 
of large chunks.

Cheers,
