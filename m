Are you running a gui environment? Can you run xosview?

It has options to configure it to display raid status (this wasn't 
working quite right when I reported it ages ago, hopefully it's fixed).

But try and get something like that, that just sits there in the 
background on your desktop, showing machine state. Then if anything goes 
wrong, hopefully your desktop will just "feel wrong" and you'll notice.

Cheers,
