Hi Hannes

Thanks for these patches. It's a good idea to make codes more clearly
that which codes belong to which file.
There are many efforts that move codes from mdadm.c and mdadm.h to
specific files. Is it better to put these
patches together? For example, the patches(6, 11, 12, 16, 19, 20, 27,
28) try to clean mdadm.c. Could you put
similar patches together? And there are some rename patches too, they
are sporadic.

For patch03, the argument is name, but it uses optarg in the function
mdadm_get_layout. Is it an error?

By the way, are there some other users who use the library besides mdadm/md=
mon?

And it's good for me if you send patches directly by email to
linux-raid mail list.

Best Regards
Xiao
