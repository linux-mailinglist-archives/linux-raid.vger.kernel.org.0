0.9 is an old layout. You'll notice that when raid details are posted it 
normally says "raid 1.2 format", which is the layout. All the raid 1.x 
formats have identical superblock format, the difference between the 
1.0, 1.1 and 1.2 formats is simply the location of the superblock. And 
it's always somewhere at the start of the partition.

0.9 is the old-style format. And it's placed at the end of the 
partition. So if the raid gets trashed somehow, because the filesystem 
starts at the start of the partition you can mount it directly if you 
have to.

I'm just thinking that if you do have boot trouble, this makes it easier 
to access your boot partition (which should be effectively read only 
almost all time), and might make recovering your system easier.

Possibly. I've not got to grips with UEFI - I learnt most of my boot-fu 
back in the days of lilo :-)
