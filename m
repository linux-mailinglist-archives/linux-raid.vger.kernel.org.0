Hi Roger,
As I mentioned, it is a:
JMicron Technology Corp. JMB363

The reason for it failing is not entirely clear, but I'm fairly sure
it's not related to your suggestions. I can make it fail at will by
using:
 dd if=/dev/sdc of=/dev/null bs=64k count=10000   and  dd if=/dev/sdd
of=/dev/null bs=64k count=10000

Now as I increase the block size of dd, the rate of errors and resets
reduces, in what seems to be a rather linear manner. (Not in any way
scientifically proven) but there is a clear relationship between
commands/sec and resets.

If I use dd on only one disk, I get no errors and no resets, and this
applies to either disk.

Thanks for the interest, however I was not trying to digress off topic
too much. I don't think the linux-raid list is responsible for all
possible controllers out there. However the interactions between
mdraid and LVM is important and this is actually why I posted
initially.

Essentially I'm hoping someone comes back and says....hey did you
check that such a file under sys/.... is clear or not etc.
i.e. My instinct tells me somehow the kernel is holding a lock on LVM
and the mount/umount commands don't seem to care. They do what is
expected and /proc/mounts is updated accordingly. That is to say, file
locking is not the problem, but something is that I have missed and I
dont have the necessary knowledge to focus down onto it.
