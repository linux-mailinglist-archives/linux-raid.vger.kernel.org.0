I'll leave that to others, but my gut reaction is just to restart it
(don't follow my advice! Wait for someone else to say it's safe :-)

Yes I do.

Wait for the system to (be) recover(ed).

MAKE SURE you've got a rescue disk with the latest mdadm and an
up-to-date kernel. I strongly suspect you've got an out-of-date system -
mdadm 3.2.2 is pretty ancient. This sounds to me like a well-known
problem from back then, and if I'm right the fix is as simple as booting
into a up-to-date recovery system, letting the reshape complete, and
then booting back into the old system.

Can someone else confirm, please!!!

Cheers,
Wol
