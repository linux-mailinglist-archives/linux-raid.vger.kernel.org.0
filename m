Thanks to you and all other answers. It helped me a lot to understand
the backgrounds.

Maybe I should open a new thread for that topic?
Please correct me, because I am not an usual admin nor an mdadm expert.

I do not want to convince you with the following! I just want to bring
up my point of view and my opinion to make it possible for you experts
to "correct" me. ;)

I do not see the advantage of creating mdadm.conf.
Via fstab I mount the devices by their UUID.
And all other information's mdadm needs to use the RAID is stored in the
superblock.

So information's in mdadm.conf would be redundant. And especially for
a non-routine home-admin like me each conf-file I modify keep the
possibility of misstakes/missconfigurations and more problems. Keeping
it as simple as possible is very important for my environment.

I do not understand this. What does "auto-assemble" means? You mean if
I plug in a SDD/HDD with a mdadm-created superblock?
