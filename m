It seems that sar is installed but not active here. Latest data is from 2017...

I am running the latest available kernel
	6.5.8-200.fc38.x86_64 #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Fri Oct 20 15:53:48 UTC 2023 x86_64 GNU/Linux

I now installed perf. Below is a grab from the console. Should I use different options?

Does anyone understand it?

BTW, I now ran rsync into the array and it barely moved. In 2 hours it copied about 5GB.
iostat shows about 5KB/s (kilobytes!) all that time.


TIA
