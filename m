My impression is that the write-journal feature isn't fully stable yet, =
as was already reported in 2019[^1]. Vojtech and me are seeing the same =
errors as mentioned there.

No matter if the journal is on a block device or another RAID.

assemble it *without* the existing journal and add an empty journal =

Then see if that changes anything.
