OK, that looks a bug, and the following change may fix the issue:

Right, so far ELEVATOR_DISCARD_MERGE doesn't merge bios actually, but it
can be supported without much difficulty.

4kb should be the discard segment length, instead of discard request
length, which should be 512k in the above test.

In the above setting and raid456 test, I observe that rq->nr_phys_segments can
reach 128, but queue_max_discard_segments() reports 256. So discard
request size can be 512KB, which is the max size when you run 1MB discard on
raid456. However, if the discard length on raid456 is increased, the
current way will become inefficient.
