And that is true, assert() is not for errors handling. Is was made for
verifying function/application flows. Like here, I made not null
function and I guarantee that won't be returned. If it comes, then it
is a developer mistake and assert() should discover that during
testing.

Please see man:
https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/assert.3.html

       If the macro NDEBUG is defined at the moment <assert.h> was last
       included, the macro assert() generates no code, and hence does
       nothing at all.  It is not recommended to define NDEBUG if using
       assert() to detect error conditions since the software may behave
       non-deterministically.

For production, the macro should be set and it generates no code. So
the behavior is configurable and OSV should add this flag to their
mdadm builds. In this case, we will end with previous implementation but
no additional error handling is required to satisfy our and external
requirements (like static code analysis).

It is also useful to validate function parameters which must be set, to
not insert dead conditions. Ideally, we should execute test with
asserts enabled to verify use cases.

Thanks,
Mariusz
