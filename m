Not affected. Use the event count and the write-intent bitmap as usual.

Not affected. An device does not need TRIM support to know which blocks 
have been written and contain valid data.

Not affected.

Same as other live metadata such as the write-intent bitmap and the 
event count, I guess.

That's precisely a  use case when a valid/discard bitmap would be useful.

The valid/discard bitmap would be only for internal use only and not 
affect TRIM/discard pass-through.

Do not pretend to be naive. I intended the topic to go to this direction 
from the start, and you knew where it was going when you replied.
