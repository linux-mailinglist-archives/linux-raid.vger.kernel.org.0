If you cannot login to the machine via ssh, also try pinging it.  If
ping works but ssh does not either ssh died, or the machine is paging
so heavily that user space cannot respond in a reasonable time.

If the disk were an issue there should be messages about something in
the disk layer timing out, but it sounds like there aren't any of
those sorts of messages.  If it was a controller hardware/pci slot/hw
issue that will in some cases cause an immediate power cycle and boot
back up.

You might also configure kdump, there should be doc's someplace on
configuring it for your distribution, once configured then test it
with "echo c > /proc/sysrq-trigger" and that should crash the machine
and leave you with a kernel core dump + dmesg from the time of the
crash.   Also if kdump is configured and working it will crash/dump
memory and typically boot back up automatically.
