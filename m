If you're worried about losing two drives, okay it's more disk space,
but add the third drive and go for three copies. Then adding the fourth
drive will give you extra space. Not the best but heigh ho.

Or make sure you've got a spare drive configured, so if one drive fails
the array will rebuild immediately, and your window of danger is minimised.
