Hi Coly,
I read that once again and I have more comments. Even if it
looks simple, we are calling many env commands in mdadm, that is why I'm
trying to be careful.

normally defined? Please remove "not".

Curios, did you verified what is happening to our "systemctl" calls?

mdmon and grow-continue are started this way, they are later followed by
"WANTS=" in udev rule so the issue there is probably hidden, maybe we
should fix these calls too?

If we are running app from terminal (i.e mdadm -I, or ./mdadm -I) this
change should not affect the terminal environment. I verified it to be
sure. Could you please mention that in description?

We can get NULL returned by getenv("PATH"), should we handle it? We
probably rely on compiler behavior here.

I did simple test. I tried: printf("%s\n", getenv("NOT_EXISTING")); 
I got segmentation fault.

I see here portability issues. We, assume that these binaries must be
in locations we added here. We may even double them, if they are
already defined.
Even if I know that probably no one is enough brave to
not have base binaries there, we should not force our PATH. I think it
is not our task and responsibility to deal with binaries location
issues. We should take what system provided.

I still think that we should pass locations during compilation. Here
example with EXTRAVERSION, of course it may require some adjustments
but it is generally the way it can be achieved:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/utils/mdadm/mdadm.git/commit/?id=03ab9763f51ddf2030f60f83e76cf9c1b50b726c

I'm not strong convinced to the option I proposed, I just need
argument because more or less code is not an argument. What we will
choose today will stay here for years, we need to choose the best
possible way we see.

The change will affect code executed later, probably we don't want
that. Shouldn't we restore old PATH here to minimize risk?

Thanks,
Mariusz
