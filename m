Most distros incrementally assemble raid arrays during early boot, 
before the real root filesystem is mounted.  By itself, with no 
mdadm.conf guidance, mdadm will assign names to arrays starting with 
md127 and counting backwards.  And will process all arrays found.

I recommend creating an mdadm.conf file containing ARRAY entries for 
your desired setup.  Trim those lines to only have the desired name and 
UUID.

Have your distro then rebuild your initramfs (distro-specific) so the 
updated mdadm.conf is available during early boot.  Reboot to see that 
it worked.

Once you are sure it works, I also recommend adding AUTO=-all to 
mdadm.conf, so any extra arrays you might plug in temporarily won't 
auto-assemble if still plugged in during boot.

Phil
