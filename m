If we don't hold some kind of lock, what are the side effects of another sync thread being started or any other reconfiguration? Are the existing flags enough to protect us from this? If we do want to hold the lock while waiting for the thread to terminate, should it be made into a mutex? If so, it probably shouldn't be static but moved into the mddev structure. I'd need weeks if not month to figure that out and to feel bold enough to post it.

- The access to *threadp needs to be after the spin_lock(). Otherwise two CPUs might read non-NULL here.

- If it was after spin_lock(), I think (!= I know), we don't need the READ_ONCE, because spin_lock() implies a compiler barrier.

- Test accidentally negated? This test is new. Is this an unrelated change? Anyway, I don't get it.

- This assignment can't be required, because we are going to kfree(thread) in the next line.
