Hi David, et al,

The principle of "My Hard Drive Died" is Scott Moulton, a highly 
respected member of the forensics and white-hat scene here in the 
Atlanta Metro Area.

https://myharddrivedied.com/

That said, I highly recommend copying the disk showing read errors onto 
another disk, keeping the log of sectors replaced by zeros. Then 
performing a file by file backup from the degraded array, using the copy 
instead of the troubled drive.

*After* you recover what you can, examine the replaced sector list and 
back-calculate what files, if any, were affected.  This will give you a 
limited and less expensive task to pay experts to solve.  Or carry on 
with whatever you ended up with.  I think your odds are good.

And yes, the pros are not cheap.
