Mythtv is a sever client DVR system. I have a client next to each of my 
TVs and one backend with large disk (this will have RAID with cache). At 
any time many clients will be accessing different programs and any 
scheduled recording will also be going on in parallel. So you will see a 
lot of seeks, but still all will be based on limited threads (I only 
have 3 TVs and may be one other PC acting as a client) So lots of IOs, 
mostly sequential, across small number of threads. I think most cache 
algorithms should be able to benefit from random access to blocks in SSD.

Do you see any flaws in my argument?

Ramesh
