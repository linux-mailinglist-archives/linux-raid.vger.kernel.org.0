True, and we definitely don't want that.


% 
% additional RAID0 on top or below another RAID won't help

I could believe that, because what I don't know about RAID would fill a
book, but I thought that the idea of RAID10 speeding up access was that
the first half of the data is on the FIRST half of the /first/ disk
and the second half of the data is on the FIRST half of the /second/
disk and so the heads only move over half the disk for reads.

[snip]

Whoops!  You're on the wrong machine.  This one mirrors two disks; that
one is the one that has a bunch.
