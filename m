As you say, it was years ago.  Things have probably changed.

At the time, the mm system would write to a device until it got marked
"congested".  If there wasn't some sort of limit on the device queue
size, you would end up with an enormous queue that would take a long
time to flush and so high-priority reads would get stuck behind
low-priority writes and weird things like that.

The writeback now has a much more sophisticated approach, measuring the
actually throughput of each device and adjusting writes accordingly.

I suspect that the best thing to do would be to remove the limit
completely.
Certainly that is the first thing I would try.  Try removing the limit,
but monitor the count of queued requests and see if something else stops
it from consuming all memory.
