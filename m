There are two processes running in the reshape_array routine, the 
original, where the user entered the mdadm grow parameter. And the 
second, forked to call systemd mdadm-grow-continue@service.Â  It's in the 
original call we want the code to continue rather than fail. It needs to 
create the backup_file in the FS before the systemd thread runs.
