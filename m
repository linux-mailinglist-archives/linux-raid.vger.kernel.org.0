Is udev part of systemd? Are there alternate implementations for the
anti-systemd-holdouts? Iirc you don't need systemd itself to have udev,
but it might provoke a few screams ...

My current (gentoo) system is OpenRC, but that's still on KDE4 and
hasn't been updated in a couple of years (don't ask why). My new system
is currently being built and is gentoo/systemd, but it's clear the
anti-systemd sentiment is still strong ...

Cheers,
Wol
