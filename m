Hi Paul,
I will disable "Discussions" panel on Github. That make sense to ask people=
 to
direct question to ML. I will try to keep "Issues" related to mdadm only.
Otherwise we will redirect people to ML. For example, in case when someone =
is
looking for help how to recover array it should be directed to ML not Githu=
b.

I think that sending notification about new pull request will be enough for
interested folks to take a look and eventually comment. So I still would li=
ke
to do review outside ML but if there is a need to consult feature/bugfix it=
 can
be sent to ML as RFC to get wider community support.

It is not one way move, we have to do what is reasonable and necessary for
mdadm to grow. It is not that we are moving to github and abandoning ML. It=
 is
and always will be a part of mdadm and can be used if needed.

More detailed answers below.
Thanks,
Mariusz

This particular problem (commit messages quality) must be addressed by revi=
ew
process itself so nothing fancy to list. We are responsible for the commits
which are comes to repository, wherever they are reviewed. At minimal,
checkpatch action will be done on each commit in PR, you can see it proposed
here:
https://github.com/md-raid-utilities/mdadm/pull/2

For the Github review GUI limitations, we have to accept them. It will be
reviewer task to make comment clear to help author move this forward. You c=
an
copy part of the commit message to comment and add link to it and say what =
you
want. Github has nice markdown support reviewer should use it to make it ea=
sier
to follow. For example, this is my comment in different project:
https://github.com/intel/ledmon/pull/193#issuecomment-1941462964
Isn't it clear?

>=20
> > We have to accept them. =20
>=20
> I do not think so. Why?

Because I think that what Github offers if enough to develop mdadm.
I don't want to reinvent the wheel because we sticked to different work
model. As I want to take this step I'm going to take what makes sense, what
gives a value and what makes developer participation easier.

That should work for 90% of patches. If we are in doubts we can always send=
 RFC
to ML to get support.

Because we want to add real CI testing and avoid maintaining it. We will ha=
ve
just Github, nothing more than that. Simple development process, everyone c=
an
contribute. It does not require to be familiarized with ML in standard cases
(for example to fix compilation issue).

https://github.com/md-raid-utilities/mdadm/pull/2
Above you have pull to mdadm which provides base testing:
- default gcc checks with various CXFLAGS
- checkpatch checks
Next, real tests will be added (we will start with enabling mdadm tests) bu=
t to
make that we need custom GH runners.

You can see well developed checks in dracut project:

For sure moving ledmon from sourceforge to github increased its visibility.=
 I
know because I was in the team at this time:
https://github.com/intel/ledmon

However, I'm not sure if that is example you are looking for. I think that
dracut matches better here. You can see that development on github is really
active but I don't know how it was in the past. For sure, it didn't kill dr=
acut.

On github I can enable issues, discussions and wiki tabs. I can also create
dedicated github.io site:
https://pages.github.com/

This all waiting and we can use that but we don't have to. I totally agree =
now
that it is better to keep discussions and support in one source, so here is=
 my
proposal:
- issues will be used to report bugs for mdadm. *For bugs*, not for reaching
  help with failed scenarios, suggestions etc.
- discussions - I will disable it because it should take place on ML.
- wiki - we have raid wiki so for now I will disable it, unless we would li=
ke
  to start noting some mdadm related information (know issues in mdadm, low
  level tasks for new developers to participate, how to compile,
  development tricks etc.) only mdadm development related things.

Anything else, goto ML.

What do you think? Can it work?

Are you asking about lkp@intel.com kernel test robot? This robot is kernel =
only
- I asked them in the past.

I think that Paul Luse can comment here more but I think that removing mdadm
patches from ML will make an effort of creating CI for MD simpler because
there will be no patches related to other project, kernel only.

Whatever requires maintenance on any side increases complexity and I think =
that
mdadm is not enough big to increase complexity. We can just use github only=
 and
reuse runners, initially created for MD testing. Any script, or daemon work=
ing
in background must be hosted somewhere (and someone needs to care
about it). I don't want that because I think that it is not necessary.

I meant that on Github we can simply achieve review and CI systems with no
additional work. The one change is only where mdadm patches are sent.

=46rom developer perspective Github workflow is easier.

You and I are reviewers of mdadm patches mainly. Comments from other people=
 are
sporadic. Thank you for all work but it is not enough. I need to try buildi=
ng
mdadm developers community and here we are shadow of MD.

Mdadm has other problems, people here are rarely interested in fixing them.

But still some RFC's for mdadm would be send here - we can always request t=
hat
on Github. As a reviewers we need to ensure that the change is good so if w=
e are
not sure, reaching mailing list would be crucial.

Does it work for you?

No, I meant that if there will be a need to they can help me reach Microsof=
t to
get more resources, but since we have create make our own runners then prob=
ably
this point has no sense. Sorry!

Thanks,
Mariusz
