Thanks for the report! I believe the reason md-linear is removed is that
we don't recognize real users, and it's deprecated for a long time.

I think it's good to introduce md-linear back, I'll send a patch and see
how other people thinks. And perhaps can you give the new md-linear a
test?

Thanks,
