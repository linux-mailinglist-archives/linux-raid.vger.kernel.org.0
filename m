common sense: in the moment you have already reads and span a RAID0 over 
them the aceess pattern is far waway from first and second disk

common sense: you wrote you are dealing mostly with small files - they 
don't gain from striping because they are typically not striped at all

well, when you mix different machines into the same thread i am out here
