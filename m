Line number will be helpful. Meanwhile, can you check if the underlying
disks has IO while raid5 stuck, by /sys/block/[device]/inflight.

Yes, please try raid10 as well. For now I'll say this is a raid5
problem.

I never do this before, I'll try.

echo 1 > delete just delete the disk from kernel, and scsi/dm-raid will
know that this disk is deleted. However, the disk will stay in kernel
for the other way, dm-raid does not aware that underlying disks are
problematic and IO will still be generated and issued.
