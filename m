No, I'm familiar.


%

Yep and good.

  diskfarm:~ # /usr/local/bin/smartctl-disks-timeout.sh 
  Drive timeouts: sda Y ; sdb Y ; sdc Y ; sdd Y ; sde Y ; sdf 180 ; sdg 180 ; sdh Y ; sdi 180 ; sdj Y ; sdk Y ; sdl 180 ; sdm Y ; 

I'll append my little enhancement of your script after my sig in case you
find the tweaks interesting.


% like 'em, but they're not good in raid. And the BarraCudas even less so!
% I've got a nasty feeling your X300s are the same!

They have been good to me so far.  I was originally going to get N300s,
but I couldn't at the time, and the X300s read as the same for everything
I could find.  Does your N300 have ERC with a short timeout enabled by
default?


% 
% I said it's easy to get slices kicked out due to misconfiguration - that's
% exactly what happens with Barracudas, and I suspect your X300s suffer the
% exact same problem ...

Well, perhaps.  I'd love to have been able to pin it down, but I never
saw any errors and, perhaps because it was too late by then, couldn't
track them down with additional help from folks here.


% 
% Read up, and come back if you've got any problems. The fix is that script,
% but it means if anything goes wrong you're going to be cursing "that damn
% slow computer".

*grin*

% Cheers,

Thanks again & HANW
