Disk:     a   b   c

Stripe:   1   1   2
           2   3   3
           4   4   5
           5   6   6

and so on.

I was trying to work out how I'd smear them a lot more randomly, but it 
was a nightmare. Iirc, no matter how many drives you have, (for two 
copies) it seems that drive a is only mirrored to drives b and c, for 
any value of a. So if you lose drive a, and then either b or c, you are 
guaranteed to lose half a drive of contents.

It also means that replacing a failed drive will hammer just two drives 
to replace it and not touch the others. I wanted to try and spread stuff 
far more evenly so it read from all the other drives, not just two. 
Okay, it increases the risk that you will lose *some* data to a double 
failure, but reduces the *amount* of data at risk (and also reduces the 
risk of a double failure!). Because if the first failure *provokes* the 
second, data loss is pretty much guaranteed.

Cheers,
Wol
