Probably something wrong inside md raid.

Do you mean it happened on both kernel versions? Could you share
relevant stacks by "cat /proc/${pid of D state process}/stack''?

Assume reshape + discard works with previous kernel version, maybe
you can try to bisect kernel tree to see which commit might caused
the bug.
