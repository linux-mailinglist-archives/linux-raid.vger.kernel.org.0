Hi,

I think you may have misunderstood slightly. Bad blocks can get written 
based on failed read requests, which is the case that Roy and I are 
complaining about. Such a read error may just be temporary, and affect 
multiple drives if there is some sort of a controller problem.

I have actually done an experiment, and I would like to explain it in 
terms of your numbered points.


1) A NFS server was set up with a share and some block files were set 
up, approx 100MB in size for each. The NFS server was given a secondary 
IP address for the client, that could be added or removed to simulate a 
passing controller failure. The NFS client mapped up this with a soft 
mount, allowing it to give IO errors after a timeout. The files were 
mapped to loopback blocks and a raid array was created, I think it was 
raid 5. The array was formatted to xfs and filled with data. Caches were 
wiped.

2) The IP was removed to simulate the controller temporarily failing. 
Then I tried reading from the raid array, producing io errors on all the 
drives. The IP was added back in to restore communication, and md took 
the opportunity to write one of the drives full of bad blocks. The rest 
of the block devices were thrown out, maybe for failing to write to the 
bad block list.

3) My attempt wasn't entirely successful, since only one drive got bad 
blocks. I think this was out of luck. In this case md will have enough 
data to repair the error during a drive replacement. Maybe if one of the 
"healthy" ones were removed, then we would see md failing to reconstruct 
data and writing bad blocks to the new device. I didn't carry this out, 
but I understand the algorithm to work like that.


The issue I have is that a temporary read failure can cause blocks to be 
marked with a flag that means "the data here is not the correct data". 
It would be necessary to handle read failures differently to have a 
distinction and be able to retry reading from these types of bad blocks. 
There's just one flag, and it's used if reading fails, if writing fails, 
if the correct data was not found for a new drive and thus the data was 
not initialized...

I've talked to Roy and we will probably try removing the lists, and I 
think it will work. At least partially. For his array, he has been 
replacing some drives from time to time without knowing about the bad 
block lists, and this means that his bad blocks are a combination of 
drives where the data actually is present, and drives where the data was 
never written in the first place. If we remove the lists, then we will 
probably get a mix of uninitialized data and correct data back. I did 
the same to my array, but I did not replace any drives so I was certain 
that I had all the data. My drives actually don't have any bad blocks at 
all, I iterated the lists and read all of the sectors.

I would expect md to state that the array is degraded, send angry emails 
and such, but it seems like you will only know the state of your BBLs if 
you go and check them.


Regards and thanks for understanding,
Håkon
