Hi,
I'm writing with a little update. I was trying to work with python
libraries pytest and ctypes. They look promising to me as with them
you can load shared objects and create unit tests. Unfortunately I
didn't manage to compile mdadm sources as library yet.
I don't think I can manage to work more on this topic anymore due to
structural changes on my team at work, so this must be postponed from
my side. Maybe one of my collegues will try to take this subject
further in the near future.=20

Thanks,
Lukasz
