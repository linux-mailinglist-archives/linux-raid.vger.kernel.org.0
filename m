I had some _very nasty_ adventures with LVM's cache, that ended with 
rather massive corruption at the end of the last year. I described it in:

https://github.com/lvmteam/lvm2/issues/26

though not much from that was answered or commented, except confirmation 
that flushing issue was fixed.

At the same time I have yet to have bcache failing on me (and it - so 
far flawlessly - did survive kernel panics (bugged nic drivers) and 
disks dying).

YMMV of course, just _make sure_ to have backups. And make sure to test 
it thoroughly in your setup (including things like hard reset).
