Hello Shaya,
DDF is not actively developed. I'm considering dropping
it.
If you are interested in bringing it too life then you are
more than welcome to send patches!

If DDF doesn't implement update_super() then fix proposed by you seems to be
valid. Please send proper patch for that then we will review it.

Thanks,
Mariusz
