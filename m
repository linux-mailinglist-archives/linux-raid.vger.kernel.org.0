Hi Mariusz

The chapter above you mentioned is talking about the creation process?
The container name mentioned from the patch is a temporary variable in
Detail function.

You want to say we can use the container name from the "static memory" in
Detail function, so we don't get the container name again? And where is the
static memory?

If you say the value returned from map_dev_preffered, you are right,
the buffer might be free and re-alloc. So the value might be lost
in the next call.

right

I'll add one description first.

At first, I just wanted to fix this bug. We can check all the places which
are using map_dev_preffered. But it looks like a big project. It needs to
understand all codes related to this function. It needs more time. Do you
agree with fixing this bug first, then we can try to fix the hidden bugs.

Yes, it takes me much time to understand how to calculate avail[]. We
can focus on
fixing this bug first, then we prepare some patches for improving the codes=
 that
related to the function map_dev_preferred and the [d*2] format codes.
It might be
a big change.

A good suggestion. Put it into the change I mentioned above, is it ok?
