Hi Paul,

I've not yet analyzed this deep enough to have a defendable explanation 
ready, sorry. My patch is
not changing the situation in regards to AVX512 vs AVX2 (both are ranked 
equal, same like before).
The only change I do is that SSE2 is ranked lower than AVX2, so cpu 
generations that have AVX2 will
stop benchmarking at AVX2 rather than also including SSE2 benchmark 
runs.

The current benchmark routine is likely too naive when you look at the 
last 20+ years of
cpu design improvements (prefetching, Out-of-Order Execution, Turbo 
modes, Energy-Cores,
AVX512 licensing turbo and many other aspects). This is not in my 
current focus, my current
focus is on lowering the tax of the benchmark.

I have seen that as well, there are two remarks on this (both not 
invalidating what Borislav wrote):

* the comment was about xor(), this patch is about gen()
* the benchmark logic does a relative ranking of approaches, so the 
absolute number fluctuation doesn't matter if they still rank the same.

I have given an explanation of how this patch affects number of 
benchmarks that are run. how long they take depends on other factors. 
this is the list of benchmarks configured (lib/raid6/algos.c the 
raid6_algos6[] array):


   #if defined(__x86_64__) && !defined(__arch_um__)
   #ifdef CONFIG_AS_AVX512
           &raid6_avx512x4,
           &raid6_avx512x2,
           &raid6_avx512x1,
   #endif
           &raid6_avx2x4,
           &raid6_avx2x2,
           &raid6_avx2x1,
           &raid6_sse2x4,
           &raid6_sse2x2,
           &raid6_sse2x1,
   #endif

without this patch, all 9 are executed. with this patch, the last 3 
(sse2x*) are skipped, leading to a 3 out of 6 or 3 out of 9 (depending 
on whether or not AVX512 is enabled) improvement, or 33%-50% as written 
above.

I'm open to any sugggestion of a wording change that makes this clearer.


Thanks,
Dirk
