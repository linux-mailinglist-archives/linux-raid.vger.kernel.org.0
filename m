+ * 'S' - add the device as a spare - don't try re-add
+ * 'j' - add the device as a journal device
+ * 'A' - re-add the device
+ * 'r' - remove the device: HOT_REMOVE_DISK

+ *       matching devices are removed.
+ * 'f' - set the device faulty SET_DISK_FAULTY
+ *       device can be 'detached' in which case any device that
+ *       is inaccessible will be marked faulty.
+ * 'I' - remove device by using incremental fail
+ *       which is executed when device is removed surprisingly.
+ * 'R' - mark this device as wanting replacement.
+ * 'W' - this device is added if necessary and activated as
+ *       a replacement for a previous 'R' device.
+ * -----
+ * 'w' - 'W' will be changed to 'w' when it is paired with
+ *       a 'R' device.  If a 'W' is found while walking the list
+ *       it must be unpaired, and is an error.
+ * 'M' - this is created by a 'missing' target.  It is a slight
+ *       variant on 'A'
+ * 'F' - Another variant of 'A', where the device was faulty
+ *       so must be removed from the array first.
+ * 'c' - confirm the device as found (for clustered environments)
+ *
+ * For 'f' and 'r', the device can also be a kernel-internal
+ * name such as 'sdb'.
+ *
+ * Return: 0 on success, otherwise 1 or 2.
