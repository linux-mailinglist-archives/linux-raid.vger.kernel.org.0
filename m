to pass it down until it finally reaches the physical device

it's impressive how many nonsense one can talk!
nothing is thrashing live-data!

so what?
it's still the underlying device

obviously it is

and here we are: it would need something which isn't there

boy: for about 8 years everything you say on this mailing list is 
guessing while you try to sound like an expert

i told you what is fact and you bubble about a perfect world which don't 
exist

the same way as you pretended convert a degradeded RAID10 to RAID1 on 
double sized disks is easy because it's only change metadata which 
pretty clear showed that you have no clue what you are talking about! 
RAID10 is striped, RAID1 is mirrored

please stop talking aboout things you have no clue about
