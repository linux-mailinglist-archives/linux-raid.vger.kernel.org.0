Hi Asaf,

All disk subsystems are inherently consistent in the normal meaning of
the term under normal circumstances.

An application that requires your specific definition of consistency
across catastrophic failure cases in the disk subsystem needs to use an
application-appropriate method of ensuring writes are flushed before
reading.  Writing with O_DIRECT is one method and depending on the
application's exact requirements may be sufficient on its own.  In other
application domains, flushing and some form of out-of-band signalling or
locking is better.  It really depends on the application.

Regards,

Geoff.
