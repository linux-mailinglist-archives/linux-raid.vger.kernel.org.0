You need to provide more details.  What is your disk setup, what is
your OS base, etc.

Is this is a vendor kernel or your own self-compiled one?  And if so,
can you move to the latest 6.x kernel instead?

More details on this setup.  Type of disks, their connectivity to the
system, etc.

Does it break if you copy the file on the system?  Do you have enough
disk space to copy a 10g file from one directory to another on the
same RAID1 setup?  

Which filesystem are you using?

Good to know.

Sorry, I'm not going to bother decoding it.  Just attach it as plain
text instead please.
