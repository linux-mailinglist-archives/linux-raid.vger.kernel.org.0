-Subject:  ANNOUNCE: mdadm 3.0 - A tool for managing Soft RAID under Linux
-
-I am pleased to (finally) announce the availability of
-   mdadm version 3.0
-
-It is available at the usual places:
-   countrycode=xx.
-   http://www.${countrycode}kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/raid/mdadm/
-and via git at
-   git://neil.brown.name/mdadm
-   http://neil.brown.name/git?p=mdadm
-
-
-This is a major new version and as such should be treated with some
-caution.  However it has seen substantial testing and is considerred
-to be ready for wide use.
-
-
-The significant change which justifies the new major version number is
-that mdadm can now handle metadata updates entirely in userspace.
-This allows mdadm to support metadata formats that the kernel knows
-nothing about.
-
-Currently two such metadata formats are supported:
-  - DDF  - The SNIA standard format
-  - Intel Matrix - The metadata used by recent Intel ICH controlers.
-
-Also the approach to device names has changed significantly.
-
-If udev is installed on the system, mdadm will not create any devices
-in /dev.  Rather it allows udev to manage those devices.  For this to work
-as expected, the included udev rules file should be installed.
-
-If udev is not installed, mdadm will still create devices and symlinks 
-as required, and will also remove them when the array is stopped.
-
-mdadm now requires all devices which do not have a standard name (mdX
-or md_dX) to live in the directory /dev/md/.  Names in this directory
-will always be created as symlinks back to the standard name in /dev.
-
-The man pages contain some information about the new externally managed
-metadata.  However see below for a more condensed overview.
-
-Externally managed metadata introduces the concept of a 'container'.
-A container is a collection of (normally) physical devices which have
-a common set of metadata.  A container is assembled as an md array, but
-is left 'inactive'.
-
-A container can contain one or more data arrays.  These are composed from
-slices (partitions?) of various devices in the container.
-
-For example, a 5 devices DDF set can container a RAID1 using the first
-half of two devices, a RAID0 using the first half of the remain 3 devices,
-and a RAID5 over thte second half of all 5 devices.
-
-A container can be created with
-
-   mdadm --create /dev/md0 -e ddf -n5 /dev/sd[abcde]
-
-or "-e imsm" to use the Intel Matrix Storage Manager.
-
-An array can be created within a container either by giving the
-container name and the only member:
-
-   mdadm -C /dev/md1 --level raid1 -n 2 /dev/md0
-
-or by listing the component devices
-
-   mdadm -C /dev/md2 --level raid0 -n 3 /dev/sd[cde]
-
-To assemble a container, it is easiest just to pass each device in turn to 
-mdadm -I
-
-  for i in /dev/sd[abcde]
-  do mdadm -I $i
-  done
-
-This will assemble the container and the components.
-
-Alternately the container can be assembled explicitly
-
-   mdadm -A /dev/md0 /dev/sd[abcde]
-
-Then the components can all be assembled with
-
-   mdadm -I /dev/md0
-
-For each container, mdadm will start a program called "mdmon" which will
-monitor the array and effect any metadata updates needed.  The array is
-initially assembled readonly. It is up to "mdmon" to mark the metadata 
-as 'dirty' and which the array to 'read-write'.
-
-The version 0.90 and 1.x metadata formats supported by previous
-versions for mdadm are still supported and the kernel still performs
-the same updates it use to.  The new 'mdmon' approach is only used for
-newly introduced metadata types.

-
-This is a bugfix release over 3.1, which was withdrawn due to serious
-bugs.  So it might be best to ignore 3.1 and say that this is a significant
-feature release over 3.0.x
-
-Significant changes are:
-  - RAID level conversion between RAID1, RAID5, and RAID6 are
-    possible were the kernel supports it (2.6.32 at least)
-  - online chunksize and layout changing for RAID5 and RAID6
-    where the kernel supports it.
-  - reduce the number of devices in a RAID4/5/6 array.
-
-  - The default metadata is not v1.1.  This metadata is stored at the
-    start of the device so is safer in many ways but could interfere with
-    boot loaded.  The old default (0.90) is still available and fully
-    supported.
-
-  - The default chunksize is now 512K rather than 64K.  This seems more
-    appropriate for modern devices.
-
-  - The default bitmap chunksize for internal bitmaps is now at least
-    64Meg as fine grained bitmaps tend to impact performance more for
-    little extra gain.
-
-This release is believed to be stable and you should feel free to
-upgrade to 3.1.1.

-
-This is a bugfix/stability release over 3.1.1.
-
-Significant changes are:
-  - The default metadata has change again (sorry about that).
-    It is now v1.2 and will hopefully stay that way.  It turned
-    out there with boot-block issues with v1.1 which make it 
-    unsuitable for a default, though in many cases it is still
-    suitable to use.
-  - Stopping a container is not permitted when members are still
-    active
-  - Add 'homehost' to the valid words for the "AUTO" config file
-    line.  When followed by "-all", this causes mdadm to
-    auto-assemble any array belonging to this host, but not
-    auto-assemble anything else.
-  - Fix some bugs with "--grow --chunksize=" for changing chunksize.
-  - VAR_RUN can be easily changed at compile time just like ALT_RUN.
-    This gives distros more flexability in how to manage the
-    pid and sock files that mdmon needs.
-  - Various mdmon fixes
-  - Alway make bitmap 4K-aligned if at all possible.
-  - If mdadm.conf lists arrays which have inter-dependencies,
-    the previously had to be listed in the "right" order.  Now
-    any order should work.
-  - Fix --force assembly of v1.x arrays which are in the process
-    of recovering.
-  - Add section on 'scrubbing' to 'md' man page.
-  - Various command-line-option parsing improvements.
-  - ... and lots of other bug fixes.

-This is a bugfix/stability release over 3.1.2
-
-Significant changes are:
-   -    mapfile now lives in a fixed location which default to
-        /dev/.mdadm/map but can be changed at compile time.  This
-	location is choses and most distros provide it during early
-	boot and preserve it through.  As long a /dev exists and is
-	writable, /dev/.mdadm will be created.
-	Other files file communication with mdmon live here too.
-	This fixes a bug reported by Debian and Gentoo users where
-	udev would spin in early-boot.
-   -    IMSM and DDF metadata will not be recognised on partitions
-        as they should only be used on whole-disks.
-   -    Various overflows causes by 2G drives have been addressed.
-   -    A subarray of an IMSM contain can now be killed with
-        --kill-subarray.  Also subarrays can be renamed with
-	--update-subarray
-   -    -If (or --incremental --fail) can be used  from udev to
-        fail and remove from all arrays a device which has been
-	unplugged from the system.  i.e. hot-unplug-support.
-   -    "mdadm /dev/mdX --re-add missing" will look for any device
-        that looks like it should be a member of /dev/mdX but isn't
-	and will automatically --re-add it
-   -    Now compile with -Wextra to get extra warnings.
-   -    Lots of minor bug fixes, documentation improvements, etcc
-
-This release is believed to be stable and you should feel free to
-upgrade to 3.1.3
-
-It is expected that the next release will be 3.2 with a number of new
-features.  3.1.4 will only happen if important bugs show up before 3.2
-is stable.

-This is a bugfix/stability release over 3.1.3.
-3.1.3 had a couple of embarrasing regressions and a couple of other
-issues surfaces which had easy fixes so I decided to make a 3.1.4
-release after all.
-
-Two fixes related to configs that aren't using udev:
-   - Don't remove md devices which 'standard' names on --stop
-   - Allow dev_open to work on read-only /dev
-And fixed regressions:
-   - Allow --incremental to add spares to an array
-   - Accept --no-degraded as a deprecated option rather than
-            throwing an error
-   - Return correct success status when --incrmental assembling 
-     a container which does not yet have enough devices.
-   - Don't link mdadm with pthreads, only mdmon needs it.
-   - Fix compiler warning due to bad use of snprintf
-   - Fix spare migration
-
-This release is believed to be stable and you should feel free to
-upgrade to 3.1.4
-
-It is expected that the next release will be 3.2 with a number of new

-This is a bugfix/stability release over 3.1.4.  It contains all the
-important bugfixes found while working on 3.2 and 3.2.1.  It will be
-the last 3.1.x release - 3.2.1 is expected to be released in a few days.
-
-Changes include:
-  - Fixes for v1.x metadata on big-endian machines.
-  - man page improvements
-  - Improve '--detail --export' when run on partitions of an md array.
-  - Fix regression with removing 'failed' or 'detached' devices.
-  - Fixes for "--assemble --force" in various unusual cases.
-  - Allow '-Y' to mean --export.  This was documented but not implemented.
-  - Various fixed for handling 'ddf' metadata.  This is now more reliable
-    but could benefit from more interoperability testing.
-  - Correctly list subarrays of a container in "--detail" output.
-  - Improve checks on whether the requested number of devices is supported
-    by the metadata - both for --create and --grow.
-  - Don't remove partitions from a device that is being included in an
-    array until we are fully committed to including it.
-  - Allow "--assemble --update=no-bitmap" so an array with a corrupt
-    bitmap can still be assembled.
-  - Don't allow --add to succeed if it looks like a "--re-add" is probably
-    wanted, but cannot succeed.  This avoids inadvertently turning
-    devices into spares when an array is failed.
-
-This release is believed to be stable and you should feel free to
-upgrade to 3.1.5

-Subject:  ANNOUNCE: mdadm 3.2 - A tool for managing Soft RAID under Linux (DEVEL ONLY)
-
-I am pleased to announce the availability of
-   mdadm version 3.2
-
-It is available at the usual places:
-   countrycode=xx.
-   http://www.${countrycode}kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/raid/mdadm/
-and via git at
-   git://neil.brown.name/mdadm devel-3.2
-   http://neil.brown.name/git?p=mdadm
-
-This is a "Developers only" release.  Please don't consider using it
-or making it available to others without reading the following.
-
-
-By far the most significant change in this release related to the
-management of reshaping arrays.  This code has been substantially
-re-written so that it can work with 'externally managed metadata' -
-Intel's IMSM in particular.  We now support level migration and
-OnLine Capacity Expansion on these arrays.
-
-However, while the code largely works it has not been tested
-exhaustively so there are likely to be problems.  As the reshape code
-for native metadata arrays was changed as part of this rewrite these
-problems could also result in regressions for reshape of native
-metadata.
-
-It is partly to encourage greater testing that this release is being
-made.  Any reports of problem - particular reproducible recipes for
-triggering the problems - will be gratefully received.
-
-It is hopped that a "3.2.1" release will be available in early March
-which will be a bugfix release over this and can be considered
-suitable for general use.
-
-Other changes of note:
-
- - Policy framework.
-   Various policy statements can be made in the mdadm.conf to guide
-   the behaviour of mdadm, particular with regards to how new devices
-   are treated by "mdadm -I".
-   Depending on the 'action' associated with a device (identified by
-   its 'path') such need devices can be automatically re-added to and
-   existing array that they previously fell out off, or automatically
-   added as a spare if they appear to contain no data.
-
- - mdadm now has a limited understanding of partition tables.  This
-   allows the policy framework to make decisions about partitioned
-   devices as well.
-
- - --incremental --remove can be told what --path the device was on,
-   and this info will be recorded so that another device appearing at
-   the same physical location can be preferentially added to the same
-   array (provides the spare-same-slot action policy applied to the
-   path).
-
- - A new flags "--invalid-backup" flag is available in --assemble
-   mode.  This can be used to re-assemble an array which was stopping
-   in the middle of a reshape, and for which the 'backup file' is no
-   longer available or is corrupted.  The array may have some
-   corruption in it at the point where reshape was up to, but at least
-   the rest of the array will become available.
-   
-
- - Various internal restructuring - more is needed.
-
-
-Any feed back and bug reports are always welcomed at:
-    linux-raid@vger.kernel.org
-
-And please:  don't use this in production - particularly not the
---grow functionality.

-
-Many of the changes in this release are of internal interest only,
-restructuring and refactoring code and so forth.
-
-Most of the bugs found and fixed during development for 3.2.1 have been
-back-ported for the recently-release 3.1.5 so this release primarily
-provides a few new features over 3.1.5.
-
-They include:
-  - policy framework
-     Policy can be expressed for moving spare devices between arrays, and
-     for how to handle hot-plugged devices.  This policy can be different
-     for devices plugged in to different controllers etc.
-     This, for example, allows a configuration where when a device is plugged
-     in it is immediately included in an md array as a hot spare and
-     possibly starts recovery immediately if an array is degraded.
-
-  - some understanding of mbr and gpt paritition tables
-     This is primarly to support the new hot-plug support.  If a
-     device is plugged in and policy suggests it should have a partition table,
-     the partition table will be copied from a suitably similar device, and
-     then the partitions will hot-plug and can then be added to md arrays.
-
-  - "--incremental --remove" can remember where a device was removed from
-    so if a device gets plugged back in the same place, special policy applies
-    to it, allowing it to be included in an array even if a general hotplug
-    will not be included.
-
-  - enhanced reshape options, including growing a RAID0 by converting to RAID4,
-    restriping, and converting back.  Also convertions between RAID0 and
-    RAID10 and between RAID1 and RAID10 are possible (with a suitably recent
-    kernel).
-
-  - spare migration for IMSM arrays.
-     Spare migration can now work across 'containers' using non-native metadata
-     and specifically Intel's IMSM arrays support spare migrations.
-
-  - OLCE and level migration for Intel IMSM arrays.
-     OnLine Capacity Expansion and level migration (e.g. RAID0 -> RAID5) is
-     supported for Intel Matrix Storage Manager arrays.
-     This support is currently 'experimental' for technical reasons.  It can
-     be enabled with "export MDADM_EXPERIMENTAL=1"
-
-  - avoid including wayward devices
-     If you split a RAID1, mount the two halves as two separate degraded RAID1s,
-     and then later bring the two back together, it is possible that the md 
-     metadata won't properly show that one must over-ride the other.
-     mdadm now does extra checking to detect this possibilty and avoid
-     potentially corrupting data.
-
-  - remove any possible confusion between similar options.
-     e.g. --brief and --bitmap were mapped to 'b' and mdadm wouldn't
-     notice if one was used where the other was expected.
-
-  - allow K,M,G suffixes on chunk sizes
-
-
-While mdadm-3.2.1 is considered to be reasonably stable, you should
-only use it if you want to try out the new features, or if you
-generally like to be on the bleeding edge.   If the new features are not
-important to you, then 3.1.5 is probably the appropriate version to be using
-until 3.2.2 comes out.

-
-This release is largely a stablising release for the 3.2 series.
-Many of the changes just fix bugs introduces in 3.2 or 3.2.1.
-
-There are some new features.  They are:
-  - reshaping IMSM (Intel metadata) arrays is no longer 'experimental',
-    it should work properly and be largely compatible with IMSM drivers in
-    other platforms.
-  - --assume-clean can be used with --grow --size to avoid resyncing the
-    new part of the array.  This is only support with very new kernels.
-  - RAID0 arrays can have chunksize which is not a power of 2.  This has been
-    supported in the kernel for a while but is only now supprted by
-    mdadm.
-
-  - A new tool 'raid6check' is available which can check a RAID6 array,
-    or part of it, and report which device is most inconsistent with the
-    others if any stripe is inconsistent.   This is still under development
-    and does not have a man page yet.  If anyone tries it out and has any
-    questions or experience to report, they would be most welcome on
-    linux-raid@vger.kernel.org.
-
-Future releases in the 3.2 series will only be made if bugfixes are needed.
-The next release to add features is expected to be 3.3.

-This release primarily fixes a serious regression in 3.2.4.
-This regression does *not* cause any risk to data.  It simply
-means that adding a device with "--add" would sometime fail
-when it should not.
-
-The fix also includes a couple of minor fixes such as making
-the "--layout=preserve" option to "--grow" work again.
-
-A reminder that the default location for runtime files is now
-"/run/mdadm".  If you compile this for a distro that does not
-have "/run", you will need to compile with an alternate setting for
-MAP_DIR. e.g.
-   make MAP_DIR=/var/run/mdadm
-or
-   make MAP_DIR=/dev/.mdadm

-Subject: ANNOUNCE: mdadm 3.3 - A tools for managing md Soft RAID under Linux
-
-I am pleased to announce the availability of
-   mdadm version 3.3
-
-It is available at the usual places:
-   http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/raid/mdadm/
-and via git at
-   git://github.com/neilbrown/mdadm
-   git://neil.brown.name/mdadm
-   http://git.neil.brown.name/git/mdadm
-
-This is a major new release so don't be too surprised if there are a
-few issues.  If I hear about them they will be fixed in 3.3.1.
-git log reports nearly 500 changes since 3.2.6 so I won't list them
-all.
-
-Some highlights are:
-
-- Some array reshapes can proceed without needing backup file.
-  This is done by changing the 'data_offset' so we never need to write
-  any data back over where it was before.  If there is no "head space"
-  or "tail space" to allow data_offset to change, the old mechanism
-  with a backup file can still be used.
-- RAID10 arrays can be reshaped to change the number of devices,
-  change the chunk size, or change the layout between 'near'
-  and 'offset'.
-  This will always change data_offset, and will fail if there is no
-  room for data_offset to be moved.
-- "--assemble --update=metadata" can convert a 0.90 array to a 1.0 array.
-- bad-block-logs are supported (but not heavily tested yet)
-- "--assemble --update=revert-reshape" can be used to undo a reshape
-  that has just been started but isn't really wanted.  This is very
-  new and while it passes basic tests it cannot be guaranteed.
-- improved locking between --incremental and --assemble
-- uses systemd to run "mdmon" if systemd is configured to do that.
-- kernel names of md devices can be non-numeric. e.g. "md_home" rather than
-  "md0".  This will probably confuse lots of other tools, so you need to
-       echo CREATE names=yes >> /etc/mdadm.conf
-  or the feature will not be used.  (you also need a reasonably new kernel).
-- "--stop" can be given a kernel name instead of a device name. i.e
-     mdadm --stop md4
-  will work even if /dev/md4 doesn't exist.
-- "--detail --export" has some information about the devices in the array
-- --dump and --restore can be used to backup and restore the metadata on an
-   array.
-- Hot-replace is supported with
-     mdadm /dev/mdX --replace /dev/foo
-  and
-     mdadm /dev/mdX --replace /dev/foo --with /dev/bar
-- Config file can be a directory in which case all "*.conf" files are
-  read in lexical order.
-  Default is to read /etc/mdadm.conf and then /etc/mdadm.conf.d
-  Thus
-      echo CREATE name=yes > /etc/mdadm.conf.d/names.conf
-  will also enable the use of named md devices.
-
-- Lots of improvements to DDF support including adding support for
-  RAID10 (thanks Martin Wilck).
-
-and lots of bugfixes and other little changes.

-The main changes are:

-   now.  Bug reports are always welcome.
- - improved interactions with 'systemd'.  Where possible, background
-   tasks are run from systemd (if it is present) rather then forking
-   disassociationg from the session.  This is important because udev
-   doesn't really let you disassociate.

-
-In mdadm-3.3 a change was made to how IMSM (Intel Matrix Storage
-Manager) metadata was handled.  Previously an IMSM array would only
-be assembled if it was attached to an IMSM controller.
-
-In 3.3 this was relaxed as there are circumstances where the
-controller is not properly detected.  Unfortunately this has negative
-consequences which have only just come to light.
-
-If you have an IMSM RAID1 configured and then disable RAID in the
-BIOS, the metadata will remain on the devices.  If you then install
-some other OS on one device and then install Linux on the other, Linux
-might eventually start noticing the IMSM metadata (depending a bit on whether
-mdadm is included in the initramfs) and might start up the RAID1.  This could
-copy one device over the other, thus trashing one of the installations.
-
-Not good.
-
-So with this release IMSM arrays will only be assembled if attached to
-an IMSM controller, or if "--force" is given to --assemble, or if the
-environment variable IMSM_NO_PLATFORM is set (used primarily for
-testing).
-
-I strongly recommend upgrading to 3.3.4 if you are using 3.3 or later.
