Doesn't this open dm up to double accounting? Take dm-delay for
instance. If the delay is 0, then submit_bio() for the underlying device
will be called recursively and will skip the accounting.  If the delay
isn't 0, then submit_bio() for the underlying device will be called
later from a workqueue and the accounting will happen again, even though
the same amount of IO happens in either case. Or am I missing something
here?
