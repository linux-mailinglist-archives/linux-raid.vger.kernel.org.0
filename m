First mistake=E2=80=A6 *Always* keep a backup (or three)

No need - what you should have done, was just to grow the array by

Partition the new drives exactly like the old ones
mdadm --add /dev/md0 /dev/sd[cd]1 # note that sd[cd] means sdc and sdd, but=
 can be written this way on the commandline
mdadm --grow --level=3D5 --raid-devices=3D4

This would have grown and converted the array to raid5 without any data los=
s.

> $ sudo mdadm --create /dev/md0 -a yes -l 5 -n 2 /dev/sda /dev/sdd

As earlier mentioned, this is to create a new array, not a conversion.

As mentioned, it doesn't look promising, but there are a few things that ca=
n be tried.

Your data may still reside on the sda1 and sdd1, but since it was converted=
 to RAID-5, the data would have been distributed among the two drives and n=
ot being the same on both. Further growing the raid, would move the data ar=
ound to the other disks. I did a small test here on some vdisks to see if t=
his could be reversed somehow and see if I could find the original filesyst=
em. I could - but it was terribly corrupted, so not a single file remained.

If this was valuable data, there might be a way to rescue them, but I fear =
a lot is overwritten already. Others in here (or other places) may know mor=
e about how to fix this, though. If you find out how, please tell. It'd be =
interesting to learn :)

PS: I have my personal notebook for technical stuff at https://wiki.karlsba=
kk.net/index.php/Roy's_notes in case you might find that interesting. There=
's quite a bit about storage there. Simply growing a raid is apparently for=
gotten, since I thought that was too simple. I'll add it.

So hope you didn't lose too much valuable data

Vennlig hilsen / Best regards
