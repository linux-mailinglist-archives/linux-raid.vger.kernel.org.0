Hi Mariusz,

Sorry for the slow response. Our daughter was born in late December and
I was on paternity leave through Feb 5, so still catching up. I also
switched teams at work back in July so my focus was shifted.

I'd very much like to see a release, and we should do one quick. Doing
more regular releases will also make it easier to ship them, so I am not
against that at all.

I am not aware of anything major pending right now, so if we can get
focus on any pending patches and get them in over the next week or two,
then I can cut an -rc and we can do a release soon. Especially if you
can help out regression testing the -rc candidate(s).

Cheers,
Jes
