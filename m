that I plan to stripe together to use to protect the first.  The Caviars
are listed as variable speed, but in practice they apparently are just
5400 rpm, so I'd like to take advantage of striping to make them as fast
as possible.  This isn't the black magic ;-) of RAID10-on-two-drives,
so I don't have to think of one as "front" and one as "back", but do I
want more than one partition on each to stripe 4 or 6 slices to avoid
hammering on one, or do I just go with each device as a whole and let
mdadm handle the magic for me?

I also plan to use a partition on the 1T drive, but once I have the
striped metadevice do I particularly want or particlularly not want to
slice a partition out of it?  I figured I would partition since that
would let me exactly match the mirror halves to each other.

Oh, and to make this more fun the two 500s are actually part of a 3-dev
RAID5 set holding the data to migrate to the 1T to then mirror, so I
don't get to destructively play with this a dozen times :-)


Thanks in advance & have a great day!

:-D
