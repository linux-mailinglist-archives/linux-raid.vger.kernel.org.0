Better yet just get another drive and copy it across. You can always do
a "dd if=/dev/md0 of=/dev/sdc1" or whatever is appropriate. (And before
anyone asks, I'm planning to copy a filesystem that way, because it's
chokker with hard links. I *really* don't want to cp the contents ...)

BUT. If you really do want to break the mirror (as I might, just to see
what happens :-), then your best bet is to add a third disk, let it
sync, then fail it off and play with that disk.

As the others said, if you have a 0.9 or 1.0 superblock, your filesystem
starts in the same place as your partition, so if you delete the
superblock the partition becomes non-raid. But if your superblock is 1.1
or 1.2, then that won't work.

Cheers,
Wol
