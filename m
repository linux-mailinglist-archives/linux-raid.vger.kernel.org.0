I agree, unless the BIOS cannot read sectors at that offset.

Or you could create a RAID10 array with the 4 partitions if they have 
similar sizes.

Or you could move /boot back into the / filesystem.

In either case, the BIOS restriction applies and you may need to 
reinstall the boot loader on both drives.

Or you could try to reduce the required space in /boot :
- remove old kernels
- reduce initramfs size with MODULES=dep instead of MODULES=most in 
/etc/initramfs-tools/initramfs.conf
- remove plymouth if installed

Swap files are an ugly hack and not all filesystems support them.
