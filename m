Is this your patch, or submitted as part of the bug report?

"Heavily based on MD badblocks code from Neil Brown"

How much has this code got to do with the mdraid subsystem? Because 
badblocks in mdraid has an appalling reputation, with many people 
wanting to just rip it out.

If this code is separate from the mdraid implementation, any chance you 
can work with it, and fix that at the same time? Or make it redundant! I 
don't quite see why mdraid should need a badblocks list given modern 
disk drives.

And it's on my to-do list (if I can find the time!!!) to integrate 
dm-integrity into mdraid, at which point md badblocks should be irrelevant.

Hope I'm not being a shower of cold water, and if you want to fix all 
this, good on you, but to the extent that this is relevant to 
linux-raid, I think a lot of people will be asking "What's the point?"

Cheers,
Wol
