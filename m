you simply don't know until the problem hits you

not so long ago some HP enterprise SSDs for example had a timebomb in 
their firmware by some 32bit counter (power on i think) which killed the 
complete device when not fixed with a firmware update - when that 
happens and all your drives are the same type and bougzt at the same day 
your RAID is gone forever

it's simply common sense that two drives with different ages and from 
different vendos are unlikely failaing within a few hours for the same 
reason

on a 4 disk RAID10 i prefer 2 different disk series with a different age 
by at least one month whenever possible
