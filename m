Good evening,

you mean https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/6/20/27 /
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/20190620061038.GA20564@lst.de/T/ ,
right? And yes, I have this problem as well. On a Toshiba z20t-c, and
this device has no option to switch this off. And even if has, there is
the problem that this device has no "normal" NVMe driver in the uefi it
seems, so it could not boot from...

Best regards,
Michael Fritscher
