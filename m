Thanks for warning me about reshapes on stretch.  I was in fact planning 
some reshapes on a production stretch system.  I shall reconsider. :)

I would be curious to read the thread in which the raid10 layout reshape 
issue has already been discussed, but I've not been able to find it.  I 
tried 'raid10 reshape', 'raid10 layout reshape', 'raid layout reshape', 
and 'reshape "attempt to access beyond end of device"' in the search box 
at [1], and I've skimmed the subject lines for the last two month's 
worth of messages, but I couldn't find anything applicable.  Are there 
other terms I should try?
