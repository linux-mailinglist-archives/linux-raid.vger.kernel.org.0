Thanks Guoqing, that certainly seems to explain it.

Would it be worth mentioning in the man page and/or wiki that when
there are devices that are very mismatched, performance wise, RAID-1
is likely to be able to direct more reads to the faster device(s),
whereas RAID-10 can't do that?

Is it just that no one has tried to apply the same optimizations to
RAID-10, or is it technically difficult/impossible to do this in
RAID-10?

Thanks,
Andy
