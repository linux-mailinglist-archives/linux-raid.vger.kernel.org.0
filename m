Bear in mind I'm now getting out of my depth, I just edit the wiki, I 
don't know the deep internals :-), but something doesn't feel right 
here. 408-416 is *nine* sectors. I'd expect it to be a multiple of 2, or 
related to the number of data drives (in your case 4). So 9 is well weird.

I would think so. You have 6 chunks per stripe, d1, d2, d3, d4, P and Q, 
  so each stripe is 2MB.

??? If it's scanning md8, then the sector numbers will be relative to 
md8. Stuff working at this level is merely scanning a block device - it 
has no clue whether it's a drive - it may well not be!

If this is a DISK block, then debugfs will be getting VERY confused, 
because it will be looking for the filesystem block 73015, which will be 
somewhere else entirely.

Not really, primarily because (a) I don't know what you're trying to do, 
and (b) because if I do understand correctly what you're trying to do, 
you're doing it all wrong.

As I said above, you'll have 2MB per slice, 4 data and 2 parity chunks. 
The parity blocks move around, so if you want to recover the data, 
you're also going to have work out which disk your data chunk is on, 
because it's not a simple 1,5,9 or 1,7,13 ...

And while, with a brand new array, the data offset will be the same 
across all drives, any management activity is likely to move the data 
around, not necessarily the same across all drives.

Yup. A quick google tells me it's the algorithm used to place the parity 
chunks.

If you've got room, put an expansion card with an eSATA port on it. Or 
yes, you could physically replace the drive, put the old one back on a 
USB port, and do an mdadm --replace. DON'T do it the other way round, 
putting the new one on a USB for the mdadm replace before swapping it in 
- experience says this is a bad move ...

I'm not sure. Neil? I'm guessing that if all four data chunks have 
survived, parity will be recalculated, and everything is hunky-dory. But 
every third block is a parity. So you'll lose one block in three, 
because raid-6 can recover two missing pieces of information, but here 
we have three - a missing block (the failed drive), a corrupt block, and 
we don't know which block is corrupt.

That's a lot of work that will almost certainly be a waste of time. The 
likely cause is parity being messed up on write, so that will be spread 
across drives.

Well, if you don't mount the partition, or you mount that read-only, 
nothing is going to write to it.

Okay. Can you mount the partition read-only and stop it getting even 
more out-of-date?

Copy the dud drive with ddrescue, and then put it into the array with 
--re-add. Hopefully it will do a re-add, not an add. And then you'll 
have recovered pretty much everything you can.

Well, unfortunately, they're going to learn the hard way ...
