In this case it should be something like --create --no-start (you don't
want to start raid volume therefore you will not need MD stuff).

--raid-devices option requires a disks. mdadm cannot guess them, you
have to pass them. typically: --raid-devices=2 /dev/sda /dev/sdb

in your case you would need new options like: --write-image=<file>

If we start supporting just writing metadata to chosen members
then /dev/md0 reference will gone.

What do you want to write to this file? I thought that you want to
write content of the file to member disks accordingly to raid layout?

Am I wrong here? wouldn't genimage generate raid array using
pre-prepared image file?

mdadm requires super user at all actions. We can challenge that in
reasonable cases. Patches are welcomed.

if mdadm is not available case is simple - no possibility to activate MD
arrays, unless v0.9 autostart but it is not a case here.

If MD module is not available then mdadm will not try to
start arrays (missing personality, no possibility.

but if MD is there and genimage (or mdadm) will close
descriptors after writing metadata to disks- raid volume may
automatically be assembled (processing of change event).
Just FYI.

Kuai was concerned that volume may appear even if you don't want it.
Theoretically it could happen.

Yes.

It is fine. I mean it would be perfect to implement something like that
for mdadm because other people may have a chance to use it but it is up
to you. If this implementation satisfies your need then you are good to
go. I will not handle this feature myself in mdadm and I don't
see anyone else interested in having this that I would ask to support.

For me it is a right change. As I said, please care to fix mdadm
because people are looking into mdadm as a source of truth.

You have my ack!
FYI, you can develop mdadm patches through github:
