Sorry a little late responding to this.

The 2MB I was referring to was the typical maximum we see on real
devices. We tested a number of NVMe drives from a number of different
vendors and found most to be a maximum of 2MB, some devices had 512KB.
Which is unfortunate.

Yeah, my hope is that larger zeroing requests can be supported which
will be handled performantly by deallocating the device. So I don't want
mdadm to slow this down by splitting the request to the kernel into a
number of smaller requests. But this seems to be the only way forward
because the request is uninterruptible and we don't want to hang the
user for several minutes.
