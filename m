AFAIK it is not planned.

We (VROC) relies on efi variables provided by UEFI. If RST UEFI driver
provides them, it will work. We didn't validate such solution so I
cannot be sure. You need to check it yourself.
The simplest way is to run #mdadm --detail-platform. Supported devices
will be listed.

I can't take the challenge at this moment, but I won't block adding
such feature in upstream. I can give some suggestions and help
with review.

Thanks,
