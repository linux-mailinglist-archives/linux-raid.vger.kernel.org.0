Except that mdadm is NOT the problem. The problem is that the kernel and
mdadm are not matched date-wise, and because the kernel is a
franken-kernel you need to use a different kernel.

Use a rescue disk!!! That way, you get a kernel and an mdadm that are
the same approximate date. As it stands, your frankenkernel is too new
for mdadm 3.4, but too ancient for a modern kernel.
