Assuming you mean md_open calls mddev_find -> mddev_get
  -> atomic_inc(&mddev->active), but the path had already existed
before b0140891a8c,  and md_alloc also called mddev_find at
that time, not sure how it prevents the race though I probably missed
something. Cc Neil.

IIUC, the issue appeared after d6263387359 (which was for dm issue),
perhaps stable maintainer should not apply this to any stable kernel
if it only includes b0140891a8ce.
