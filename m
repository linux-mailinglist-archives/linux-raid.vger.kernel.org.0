Honestly, I don't see how this is can be successful without a more
significant change than you may be anticipating. I'd be happy to hear if
there's a better solution, but here's what I'm thinking:

You'd need each stacking layer to return a cookie that its poll function
can turn into a list of { request_queue, blk_qc_t } tuples for each bio
the stacking layer created so that it can chain the poll request to the
next layers.

The problems are that the stacking layers don't get a cookie for the
bio's it submits from within the same md_make_request() context. Even if
you could get the cookie associated with those bios, you either allocate
more memory to track these things, or need polling bio list link fields
added 'struct bio', neither of which seem very appealing.

Do you have a better way in mind?
