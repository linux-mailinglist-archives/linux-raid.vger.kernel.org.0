Not sure if I've got the wrong end of the stick, but if I've understood 
correctly, that shouldn't be the case.

Reshape takes place in a window. All io *beyond* the window is allowed 
to proceed normally - that part of the array has not been reshaped so 
the old parameters are used.

All io *in front* of the window is allowed to proceed normally - that 
part of the array has been reshaped so the new parameters are used.

io *IN* the window is paused until the window has passed. This 
interruption should be short and sweet.

Cheers,
Wol
