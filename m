Hi Geoff

Thanks for the explanation.

raid1 can be loaded automatically. So it doesn't need to set
CONFIG_MD_RAID1 to y.

I'm a little confused here. If I understand right, for the os that
doesn't use initrd
and we still have the ability to set CONFIG_MD=3Dy, so we can set it to
y and rebuild
the kernel. So the raid1 can be assembled by md auto-detect, right?

Thanks for this information
