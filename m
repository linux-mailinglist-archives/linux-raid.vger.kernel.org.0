Hi Christoph and Heming,

Trying to understand the whole picture here. Please let me know if I
misunderstood anything.

IIUC, the primary goal of Christoph's set is to get rid of the
ERESTARTSYS hack from md,
and eventually move bd_mutext. 02/15 to 07/15 of this set cleans up
code in md.c, and they
are not very important for the rest of the set (is this correct?).

Heming, you mentioned "the solution may simply return -EBUSY (instead
of -ENODEV) to
fail the open path". Could you please show the code? Maybe that would
be enough to unblock
the second half of Christoph's set (08/15 to 15/15)?

Once this part is resolved, the bug fix (this patch thread) and the
clean up (Christoph's 02 - 07)
should be easier.

Would this work?

Thanks,
Song
