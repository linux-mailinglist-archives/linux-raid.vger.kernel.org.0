Okay, so read performance from the array is worse than you would expect 
from a single drive. And the heads should not be "flying there and back" 
- they should just be streaming data. That's actually worrying - a VERY 
plausible explanation is that your drives are on the verge of failure!!

The drives shouldn't need to reorder the operations - a rebuild is an 
exercise in pure streaming ... unless there are so many badblocks the 
whole drive is a mess ...

Actually, you might find (counter-intuitive though it sounds) REDUCING 
the max sync speed might be better ... I'd guess from what you say, 
about 60MB/s.

The other thing is, could you be confusing MB and Mb? Three 250Mb drives 
would peak at about 80MB.

What make/model are your drives? What does smartdrv say about them? And 
take a look at

https://www.ept.ca/features/everything-need-know-hard-drive-vibration/

The thing that worries me is your reference to repeated seeks. That 
should NOT be happening. Unless of course the system is in heavy use at 
the same time as the rebuild.
