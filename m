Hi, this is your Linux kernel regression tracker.

Nitpicking: From the list of CCed people it seems these patches are
fixing this regression:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-raid/0eb91a43-a153-6e29-14b6-65f97b9f3d99@nuclearwinter.com/

Then the patch descriptions for the two commits should include a link
tag to the report, as per using lore.kernel.org/r/, as explained in
'Documentation/process/submitting-patches.rst' and
'Documentation/process/5.Posting.rst'. And the original reporters likely
should be honored with a "Reported-by", too. The former would my
regression tracking life a lot easier, as regzbot relies on those links
that are useful for other purposes, too (as explained in the docs).

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)

P.S.: As the Linux kernel's regression tracker I'm getting a lot of
reports on my table. I can only look briefly into most of them and lack
knowledge about most of the areas they concern. I thus unfortunately
will sometimes get things wrong or miss something important. I hope
that's not the case here; if you think it is, don't hesitate to tell me
in a public reply, it's in everyone's interest to set the public record
straight.
