I think it means that currently you have to create kernel (MD) raid
device (assemble using metadata) to have a chance creating image.

I agree. The right way is to incorporate it with mdadm.
We should create a volume image (data) without MD internals.

With that, we will have control on this functionality. Also, we will be
able to provide support for every metadata format.

I don't think we need to care. They goal is to not have and use MD
module so mdadm will fail to load personalities.

Sorry, This is old application and some solutions are here for years-
they are working so nobody tried to change them. If you are looking for
challenges this software is full of them!

Thanks,
