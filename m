How it got into this state is probably easy. Various people on the list 
say "don't use badblocks !!!" - it's a mess. The easy way to fix that is 
simply to assemble the array with --force-no-badblocks or whatever.

The concern with that is if the problem is actually nothing to do with 
badblocks itself, and everything to do with what's underneath them. So 
don't be too hasty.

I'll leave it to the experts to dig into your problem in more detail.

Cheers,
Wol
