This may not be the forum to ask this but what exactly is "compiling the 
kernel". From what I've been reading, it sounds like a somewhat involved and 
complex process - is it? Is compiling a new kernel the same as upgrading the 
OS? I'm getting the impression that it sort of is but sort of isn't. Is it 
possible to compile a kernel for a rescue CD (from the comments I've read, 
it is possible)? If I were to compile a new kernel, would I expect the 
version number for the kernel and mdadm to be the same? Sorry for all the 
question but, as I said at the outset, a lot of this is all very new to me.

Thank you,
Bob

and nowhere did i say reboot now

and i only responded to your "Do I understand that you would recommend 
upgrading our installation of Linux once the repair is complete or are 
advising downloading and compiling a new kernel as part of the repair?"

nobody said that - the only point was use a as recent kernel as possible 
with all rgow/reshape operations
