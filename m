Hi Xiao,

Thanks for the excellent feedback.  Since bitmap_offset appears to be
a free-form field, it wasn't apparent to me that the bitmap never
starts within 4K of the bitmap.

I don't think it's worth worrying about a logical block size that's
more than 4K here--from what I can see logical block size larger than
the usual 4K page isn't going to happen.

I do think that it makes sense to handle the case where the physical
block size is more than 4K.  I think what you propose works, but I
think in the physical block > MAX_SB_SIZE case it makes more sense to
align the superblock writes to the physical block size (as now) rather
than rejecting the create/assemble.  Mounting with the possible
performance hit seems like a better outcome for the user in that case
than refusing to assemble.
It's the same check that would have to be written to reject the
assembly in that case and so the code shouldn't really be any more
complex.

So basically what I propose is:  if the physical block size is no
larger than MAX_SB_SIZE, pad to that; otherwise pad to to
logical_block_size, that is, replace queue_logical_block_size()
with something equivalent to:

    queue_physical_block_size(...) > MAX_SB_SIZE ?
queue_logical_block_size(...) : queue_physical_block_size(...)

which is simple, safe in all cases, doesn't reject any feasible
assembly, and generates aligned sb writes on all common current
devices (512n,4kn,512e.)

What do you think?

Regards,

  --Chris
