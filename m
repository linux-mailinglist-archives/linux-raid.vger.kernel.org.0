Thanks for the info on bcache. I do not think it will be my favorite. I 
am going to try LVM cache as my first choice. Note that the new disks 
will be spare disks for some time and I will be able to try out a few 
things before deciding to put it into use.

One thing about LVM that I am not clear. Given the choice between 
creating /mirror LV /on a VG over simple PVs and /simple LV/ over raid1 
PVs, which is preferred method? Why?
