Yeah, that's a problem.

One option would be to make sure that ->bi_rw is set before
bio_add_page is called.
There are about 80 calls, so that isn't trivial, but you might not care
about several of them.

You could backport the 'kill merge_bvec_fn' patch if you like, but I
wouldn't.  The change of introducing a bug is much higher.
