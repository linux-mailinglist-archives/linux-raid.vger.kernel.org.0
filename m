I am sorry that I was not clear enough and therefore:

* You failed to understand the relevance of "note the difference
  between reads and writes" which I added precisely because I
  guessed that someone unfamiliar with storage device would need
  that terse qualifier.

* You failed to understand the relevance of the "to minimize the
  chances of declaring a drive failed".

* You failed to realize that I was addressing tersely the
  original poster's case of a drive being declared failed
  because of a drive timeout longer than the kernel command
  timeout, without going in detail about all other possible
  cases.
