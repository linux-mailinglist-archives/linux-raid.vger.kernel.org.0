The kernel and/or mdadm decides the same way it decides what drive is 
sda, sdb, etc, in that it is COMPLETELY RANDOM. Yes, the dice normally 
fall the same way and names are consistent, but numbers now normally 
always count down from 127. (I think that's so we can count down from 
32,000 if we need to... :-) For example, because I have just two, 
mirrored, drives, it doesn't matter which one appears first the arrays 
count down consistently so eg root is always md127. But that's a quirk 
of my system.

The recommended way with mdadm is to create named arrays, eg 
/dev/md/root or /dev/md/home.
