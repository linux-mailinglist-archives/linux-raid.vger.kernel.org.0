I am happy to share that my plan as outlined below worked. I now have /boot, /boot/efi and / on separate RAID partitions with the latter managed by LVM and encrypted.  All data from the old disk is now on the new setup and everything seems to be working.

However, going back to the issue of /boot/efi possibly not being duplicated by CentOS, would not mdadm take care of that automatically? How can I check?
