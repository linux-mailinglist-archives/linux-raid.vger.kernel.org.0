% Barracuda ... DO NOT USE THIS IN A PARITY RAID ARRAY !!!

I am aware of the general problem, and I run the handy timeout script

  # set the timeouts on the local drives
  printf "${CBLU}Drive timeouts${CBLK}: "
  for DISK in sda sdb sdc sdd sde sdf sdg sdh     # a-d on mobo ; e-h on card
  do
    printf "$DISK "
    smartctl -q errorsonly -l scterc,70,70 /dev/$DISK
    if [ 4 -eq $? ]
    then
      echo 180 > /sys/block/$DISK/device/timeout
      printf "${CYLO}180"
    else
      printf "${CGRN}Y"
    fi
    printf "${CBLK} ; "
  done
  echo ''

to reset as needed, and I even have no plans to parity this drive, but I
didn't realize that it was a problem disk!  Thanks for the heads-up.


% 
% Mirroring as you plan here is okay.

That's good.  Of course, that then makes me scratch my head a bit since
it's still paired with other and needs to not blow up ...  I'll have to
back and read more to see why mirror is safe.

Yeah, I'm not too happy about that ...  Supposedly they will vary speed
based on demand, so they can deliver 7200rpm performance, but apparently
they always stay at 5400rpm and so they're just basic drives.  Meh.


% me nervous. Check SCT/ERC, but striping/mirroring will be fine.

More of that confusion stuff :-) but happy.

Correct.


% 
% Create a striped device using the two 500GB drives.

That's the fun part ...  I'm thinkin' I'm just going to have to do sector
math to predict how large the new dev can be so that I can back into a
proper partition size on the 1T so that both halves can match.

How much overhead does md need for striping (RAID0)?  Given these two

500G disks (976773100 total sectors each, right?), how large a partition
can I create on this

  jpo:~ # parted /dev/sdb unit s print free

1T disk (1953525104 sectors, which is 21096 less than the 2ea others
together) can I create and expect to be able to match it across the pair?

Is this something I could mock up with overlays without destroying the
existing data?


% 
% Add the striped device to the 1TB mirror.

At that point it becomes easy :-)


% 
% Plan to replace all the disks with something like Seagate Ironwolves or

Actually, I have four Seagate 4T drives
