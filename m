I have couple old CPU's I5 4670K and I7 4790K, both have idle locking 
issues. I solved my issue boosting voltages little from bios. I7 from 
friend and I know it's been heavily overclocked and it's so bad that if 
I use stock settings what bios set, I cannot even install OS because it 
just lock up or crash on install.
But when I boost voltages, it does run stable. Another lockup source 
what I have got is memory. I was trying to add 16GB momory, but sticks 
are not same brand and speed and they just don't play nice together even 
if I run them with stock settings.
