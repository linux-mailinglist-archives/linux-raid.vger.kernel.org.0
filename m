Check "Used Dev Size" in "mdadm --detail" of your array. I suppose that is how
much (at least) it actually needs from any new member to be suitable for the
array.

If you find it needs more than the size of sdk1, as an emergency measure you
could wipe off the partition table and add the entire sdk as the array member.
While usually not recommended, if you don't boot other operating systems on
the same machine (that could see the "raw" drive and mess with it), it should
not cause any problem.

However there should not be such size difference in the first place, check
your dmesg if drive detection messages report "HPA", and/or check with "hdparm
-N" if there's this HPA enabled, cutting off a portion of the drive at the end.
