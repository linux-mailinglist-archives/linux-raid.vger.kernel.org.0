True but dup metadata is a small cost to have self-healing file system
metadata. While read errors mean md will reconstruct from parity, and
Btrfs would be none the wiser, Btrfs is more sensitive to certain
kinds of metadata loss than other file systems.

Where dup is pointless is the case of deduplication by SSDs with
concurrent writes, and dup metadata uses concurrent writes - i.e. it's
not going to delay writing one of the copies which is what it'd take
to thwart common internal SSD optimizations. Even those that don't
dedup, concurrent writes end up on the same erase block. And if
there's a hardware failure, it tends to affect an entire erase block.

At least hmzoned Btrfs will disable features considered incompatible
with SMR: raid56, nodatacow (overwrites), and fallocate which also
implies overwrites.
