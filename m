I think the key decider in whether or not a RAIDed swap should be a must-have,
is whether the system has hot-swap bays for drives.

Also, it seemed like the discussion began in the context of setting up a home
machine, or something otherwise not as mission-critical. And in those cases,
almost nobody will have hot-swap.

As such, if you have to bring down the machine to replace a drive anyway, might
as well tolerate the risk of it going down with a bang (due to a part of swap
going away), and enjoy a faster swap on either RAID0 or multiple independent
swap zones for the rest of the time.
