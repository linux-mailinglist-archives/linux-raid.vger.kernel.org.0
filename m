Oh!  Well, that's nice to know.  Of course, I had been hoping to move
these out to another system after upgrading to larger, but maybe that's
not an option :-(  They are going to be worlds better than the existing
crap drives in there now, though, so here's hoping I can put them to use.

Thanks!

Ouch.  I sure hope they're cheaper over here!  Unfortunately, when I was
shopping I was looking at ... Barracudas :-/

Thanks; I'll have a look.

I checked and I have 2.7 on this box, so I figure it would work.  But I
can barely spell Python, much less understand it.


Thanks again & HAND
