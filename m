https://raid.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Linux_Raid

This is as close to official as you'll get. Failures tend to follow a 
pattern, and I do try and document any variation I see, but it does tend 
to be a case of "either it's easy or it turns into a big recovery job".

Look especially at
https://raid.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Linux_Raid#When_Things_Go_Wrogn
and if it's not an easy fix (it might be as simple as a forced-assembly 
followed by a fsck), post the requested info to the list and somebody 
should dive in and help.

Cheers,
Wol
