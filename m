Hi Alexander,

Thanks for the report.

Did super_1_validate() set the bad drive as Faulty?

                switch(role) {
                case MD_DISK_ROLE_SPARE: /* spare */
                        break;
                case MD_DISK_ROLE_FAULTY: /* faulty */
                        set_bit(Faulty, &rdev->flags);
                        break;

AFAICT, this should stop the bad drive from going bad to the array.
If this doesn't work, there might be some bug somewhere.

Thanks,
Song
