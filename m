Thanks for your response.
I'm wondering if this change will be used if not will be set as default. 
I suggest providing a new flag with old, deprecated version, for any of 
uses where it couldn't be changed. I can add a description which clarify 
the change and describe flag, for anybody who will meet errors with 
scripts after this change.
