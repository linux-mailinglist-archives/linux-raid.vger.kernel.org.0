The reason I reacted with horror at the previous message is that 
/dev/sdd1 is already part of the array. Adding /dev/sdd (which is quite 
possible) would destroy /dev/sdd1 and you'd be left with only one 
working partition out of three - that's the array gone ...

Read the wiki on how to add a drive. I suspect that's where you went 
wrong in the first place. Make sure you've got the right drive to add - 
it said you had sdb1 and sdd1, so sdc1 is missing and that's the one you 
want to add (CHECK BEFORE YOU ADD). The kernel can move things around so 
make sure between booting and adding that nothing "weird" has happened.

Then you should be good to go. Just CHECK. And DOUBLE CHECK.

Cheers,
Wol
