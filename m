Using only Debian-based distributions and GRUB, I confess that I know 
very little about other distributions and boot loaders such as Red Hat 
and systemd-boot. In Debian, package upgrades do not happen during the 
boot sequence, so waiting for the next boot to sync EFI partitions 
implies that they will be out of sync when the boot loader is run at the 
next boot, possibly breaking the boot sequence.

Quoting:
"with uefi you can no longer have everything needed for boot on a RAID"

AFAIK, that was never possible with legacy BIOS boot either. The MBR and 
GRUB core image were outside RAID.
