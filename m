Okay. Find a liveCD that supports raid (hopefully something like 
SystemRescueCD). Make sure it has a very recent kernel and the latest mdadm.

All being well, the resync will restart, and when it's finished your 
system will be fine. If it doesn't restart on its own, do an "mdadm 
--stop array", followed by an "mdadm --assemble"

If that doesn't work, then
