I won't buy a marvell.    I had some sort of 92xx variant (2 pci-e
lanes) and it had a bad habit of stopping working under load and
causing all 4 ports to go offline.   Board maker blamed the driver
except the driver is/was the generic AHCI so unlikely to be the issue
since all other ports were also AHCI and were just fine.

Best luck is a used LSI SAS controller.   You can get 8 ports off of
one, but you may need a breakout cable to use for 4 sata devices.
