I have mdadm.conf and each md is named in that file.

ARRAY /dev/md/1 metadata=1.2 name=zym:md1 
UUID=0e9f76b5:4a89171a:a930bccd:78749144
ARRAY /dev/md2  metadata=1.2 name=zym:2 
UUID=d4e30060:d6395b41:dde52d2e:35ffa6fd

They are named md0, md1, md2 etc because I created them that way, I 
think. Once created, they are entered into mdadm.conf and they keep 
their name.

I usually image copy system disk from old machine to new machine to 
bootstrap the system. Thus mdadm.conf will go there. That is why I 
cannot have /dev/md0 in the old machine as that name is already taken in 
the new machine. Without image copy, it is difficult to get mythtv 
package to keep its database and recordings in order.

Ok, I will try this. I am more worried about old host not booting after 
I yank the disks and it does not find them to assemble md that 
mdadm.conf has. I am going to comment out the line for the md (and 
update-initramfs for a good measure) that I plan to transfer. This way, 
I should be safe.

I thought I looked there first before searching online. I do not believe 
you have any section for renaming md device after its creation.

I also did not find any instructions on how to not assemble array upon 
reboot and leave the component disks untouched. This will make the 
transfer seamless.

Thanks for taking interest in my situation. Just helping me to think 
differently itself is great help and I appreciate that help.
