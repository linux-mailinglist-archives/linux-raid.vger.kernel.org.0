Jumping into this one late, but I thought the main risk was related to 
the fact that for every read there is a chance the device will fail to 
read the data successfully, and so the more data you need to read in 
order to restore redundancy, the greater the risk of not being able to 
regain redundancy.

So, assuming all drives are of equal capacity, you will need to read 
less data to recover a RAID10 than you would to recover a RAID5/6, thus 
a RAID10 has a better chance to recover.

1) speed of recovery (quicker to read 1 x drive capacity instead of n x 
drive capacity even if all in parallel) (unless you can sustain full 
read speed on all devices concurrently I guess).

2) equal load on the single "mirror" device from RAID10 compared to load 
on ALL devices in the RAID5/6.

3) lower impact to operational status (ie, real work load can continue 
without impact on all reads/writes not involving the small part of the 
array being recovered, equal impact for read/write that does involve 
this part of the array).

Right?

Regards,
Adam
