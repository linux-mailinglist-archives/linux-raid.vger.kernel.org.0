If that's the route you're looking at, I'm trying to source a Cooler 
Master N300 case, which takes EIGHT 3.5" drives. Most of them are 
internal so hotswap is out of the question, though.

Dunno what's happened with the cases - have they dropped the line? Or 
has CoVid just exhausted current supplies?
