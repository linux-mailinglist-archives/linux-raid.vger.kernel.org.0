Oops, yes, I'll update the commit message for v3.

Ok, will do for v3.

I don't see any appropriate defines in the code base. It really just
needs to be bigger than any O_DIRECT restrictions. 4096 bytes is usually
the worst case.

I added the hex because it might be informative to know what a discard
did to the device (all FFs or random data).

That's correct. I discussed this in the cover letter. That's why this
check is here. Per some of the discussion from others I still think the
best course of action is to just check what the discard did and fail if
it is non-zero. Even though many NVMe and ATA devices have the ability
to control or query the behaviour, the kernel doesn't support this and
I don't think it can be relied upon.

As I understand it the offset and size will give the bounds of the
data region on the disk. Do you not think it works for zoned raid0?

Well it was my opinion that it was clearer in the code to just
explicitly include discard in the conditionals instead of making discard
also set assume-clean, but if you think otherwise I can change it for v3.

What kind of user message are you thinking is necessary here?
