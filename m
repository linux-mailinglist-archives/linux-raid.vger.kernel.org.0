Sure. But the two competing scripts make logic difficult to follow.

I don't understand why you want to keep two concurrent services doing
the same thing. What potential backward compatibilty issue does this
solve?=C2=A0

I agree that backward compatibility is important for mdcheck itself and
its various incantations, but I have a hard time getting the point for
the services. What matters here, AFAICS, is that we have a "long" time
interval in which we start new checks, and a "short" one in which we
continue previously started ones (defaulting to "1 month" and "1 day",
respectively). My patch doesn't change these semantics. Actually, it
makes them more obvious.

I also don't understand how we'd be able to deprecate
mdcheck_continue.service if we want to keep both services.

Anyway, to avoid going in circles, I will just drop the patch you
dislike. As discussed, it isn't strictly necessary to avoid the known
race.
