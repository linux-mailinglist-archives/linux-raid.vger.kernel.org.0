I may have to fall back to that, but the system is supposed to be doing
this for me dammit! :)

The initrd is using busybox 1.30.1 mdev and mdadm 4.0 both linked
against musl -- if this has suddenly broken, I suspect a lot of udevs
have similarly broken. But these are both old, upgraded only when
essential to avoid breaking stuff critical for boot (hah!): upgrading
all of these is on the cards to make sure it's not something fixed in
the userspace tools...

(Not been rebooting because of lots of time away from home: now not
rebooting because I've got probable flu and can't face it. But once
that's over, I'll attack this.)

Definitely not! This kernel is almost totally non-modular:

compiler@loom 126 /usr/src/boost% cat /proc/modules 
vfat 20480 1 - Live 0xffffffffc0176000
fat 73728 1 vfat, Live 0xffffffffc015c000

That's *it* for the currently loaded modules (those are probably loaded
because I built a test kernel and had to mount the EFI boot fs to
install it, which is not needed during normal boots because the
initramfs is linked into the kernel image).
