The other thing is, what superblock are you using? Sounds to me like
you're trying to use an unsupported and bit-rotting option.

Standard procedure today is that you MUST run mdadm to assemble the
array, which means having a functioning user-space, which I believe
means initrd or some such to create the array before you can make it root.

You saying that you need to read the partition table even when you have
a successfully assembled array makes me think something is weird here ...

If you can give us a bit more detail, we can then decide whether what
you're doing is supposed to work or not.

Basically, as I understand what you're doing, you need a 0.9
(unsupported) superblock, and also (unsupported) in-kernel raid assembly.

Cheers,
