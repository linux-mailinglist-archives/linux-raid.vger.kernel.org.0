Agreed, all I need is a file level LRU caching effect. All recently 
accessed/created files in SSD and the ones untouched for a while in 
spinning disks. I was trying to get this done using a block level 
caching methods which is too complicated for the purpose.

My aim is not to improve the performance, instead improve on power. I 
want my raid disks to be mostly sitting idle holding files and spin up 
and serve only when called for. Most of the time, I am 
watching/recording recent shows/programs or popular movies and typically 
that is about 200-400GB of storage. With ultraviolet, prime, netflix and 
disney, movies are more often sourced from online content and TV shows 
get deleted after watching and new ones gets added in that space. So, 
typical usage seem ideal for popular SSD size (with a large backup store 
in spinning disk), I think. This means my spinning disks are going to 
wake up once a day or two at most. More often I expect it to be once a 
week or have periods of high activity and die down to nothing for a 
while.  Instead, currently they are running 24x7 which does not make sense.

Regards
Ramesh
