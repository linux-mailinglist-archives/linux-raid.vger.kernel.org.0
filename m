Same reason I do? I have a whole bunch of rarely used, and not-at-all 
critical tmpfs's, so the system occasionally spills into swap. A system 
failure is no grief - reboot, carry on where it left off ...

Linux Filesystem Hierarchy Standard? The presence of ANY files in /tmp 
is not to be trusted - even if you created it ten seconds ago ...

And most people nowadays - certainly on a single-user system - will have 
no reason to care. Certainly my system, with 32GB of ram, is very 
unlikely to spill into swap in normal operation ...
