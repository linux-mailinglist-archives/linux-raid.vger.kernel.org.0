Hello Roger.

It was Intel in both cases and the CPU loads were low.

ites.

Of course, but even of that the speed was poor :]

Nope, the array was not mounted and no process was touching the MD device=

during the rebuild.

In the first case there was no space left for another drive ... however,=

sometimes I can do the rebuild offline and in such cases I'll rather
clone the content of the old drive with DD. It's much faster.

I usually do that on servers where I have multiple raid partitions.

Thx,
Jaromir.
