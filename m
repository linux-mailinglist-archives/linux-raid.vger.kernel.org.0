Are they "raid friendly" though? What does "smartctl" tell you? Are the 
Seagates Barracudas (I hope not)?

Whether before or after the copy, I'd look at the smartctl for the dodgy 
drives - they may have just been addled by the power fail but will be 
fine for backups, or they may have been on the way out and the power 
fail tipped them over the edge.

Cheers,
Wol
