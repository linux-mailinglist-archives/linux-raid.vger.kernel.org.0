Do you really believe a program can lose some of its data and still 
behave as if nothing happened ? If that were true, then why not just 
discard data instead of swap them out when memory is short ?

Conversely, some systems, under some workloads, do need swap. And when 
they do, swap needs to be as reliable as any other storage space.

Firstly, the *system* is not only the kernel. Many user space processes 
are part of the *system*. Secondly, you were the one who wrote:

"/tmp - is usually tmpfs nowadays, if you need disk backing, just make 
sure you've got a big-enough swap (tmpfs defaults to half ram, make it 
bigger and let it swap)."

No, this is what backup is meant to. RAID does not protect your data 
against accidental or malicious deletion or corruption. RAID is meant to 
provide availabity. The benefit of having everything including swap on 
RAID is that the system as a whole will continue to operate normally 
when a drive fails.
