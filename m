what is the point here? Why it is odd? Implementation is driven by needs so we
care of what is wanted on the market. We don't have to implement all invented
raid levels.

Bad decision? I don't think so. You are using strong words as a new person in
this community. Why you are trying to judge was is better? I don't feel that
you are right person to make any statements especially attacking previous
maintainers of this product.

Oh, here is the trade-off.

I don't think that performance (speed?) is increased because you need to update
multiple chunks to save data which is obviously memory and time consuming.
Full stripe writes are not limited with this solution. At a first glance, it is
a performance killer.

So you expect features to repair you budget? Well, that is not a purpose of
RAID array. We cares to not make situation worse, not to fix media issues.
It can be done in firmware if needed. We can make some low-cost
optimization but we cannot risk huge performance impact.

Did you heard about MD stacked raid or IMSM matrix raid?

Go ahead and implement it then, it is open source but.. We will decide if it is
worthy. There is no data that can prove efficient of your solution, it is more
marketing speaking now.

It is not devastating, that is not true. You came here to say "I have a great
solution for QLC drive, you have to do this". You cannot demand that. If you
want something you are free to write it and we together will decide if it is
good.

For me, this is a trade-off between performance, size and nvme lifetime. There
are reasons why RAID2 is dead, binary layout is not efficient. Dividing raid
array into 3/4 for data and 1/4 for RAID2 seems weird to me.. Why not 3/5 and
2/5? It is always trade-off between multiple factors. You care the most about
SSD lifetime, I have different opinion and I see performance as crucial.
