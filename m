As others have said, if your mobo doesn't support hotplug, DON'T TRY IT!

Otherwise, use eSATA (or USB).>

As others have said, it doesn't matter. Not sure if as the other person 
said md uses uuids, or if it just scans all partitions, and looks for a 
superblock.
What I would say (and it's not for raid1, but definitely raid 5/6) if 
you do have parity raid then make sure every time you change the config, 
generate an mdadm.conf file (or whatever it's called). While md doesn't 
use it, if you have a problem with your raid you will wish you had it!

As I say, you're raid 1, you don't need it now, but if you ever do 
change, DO IT!

Cheers,
Wol
