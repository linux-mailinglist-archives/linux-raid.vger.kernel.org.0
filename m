Hi Jes,

I was in this place with ledmon project:
https://github.com/intel/ledmon/blob/master/src/status.h

Yeah, it seems to be overhead to maintain error enum per each subsystem yet, you
are right here. I don't plan huge code reactor to make those enums common used.
If we don't plan mdadm library, then there is no need to handle define multiple
enums. It has real sense if we want to hide some statuses from library user
inside our code.

I would like to handle internal error definitions because I think that mdadm
deserves flexibility to define status what it needs. In general case we needs
just *error* but when it comes to more advanced flows I can see multiple
meaningful statuses we need to differentiate. The goal here is to make errors
straightforward.

I don't consider it as reinventing the wheel because the software is free
to define error handlers as it wants. There are no restrictions and POSIX codes
are not a solution. POSIX codes are available to us because we need to
understand kernel error codes and we need to handle them and react
appropriately.

Simply, I would like to have error possibly the best self described and the
error enum allows me to achieve that. It also forces developers to
follow the statuses we have there because if something like that is defined,
there is high probability that maintainer will ask developer to use this enum
in new function and use meaningful error codes respectively.

I would like to add this enum to mdadm.h but I will avoid to adding more enum
in the future if there is no need to. Let me know if that works for you.

Thanks for discussion!
Mariusz
