Thanks for the patches.

I went through the first half of the set, most of the code looks fine.
However, there is
one issue: the way you split the changes into 12 patches is not ideal. The most
significant issue is that build failed after 5/12 or 6/12 (and was
fixed after 9/12). We
would like every commit build successfully. I think the proper fix is
to break 9/12 and
merge changes in raid5.c to proper patches. Also, I think we can merge
1/12 and 2/12.

Please resubmit after these changes.

Thanks,
Song
