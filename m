what was your point when we all know that the MBR wanst't part of the 
RAID and frankly wasn't stored inside a partition at all

my point in that bugreport is that i don't want to manually call 
"backup-efi.sh" after kernel updates which are happening often on Fedora

kernel-install.sh is responsible for create the initrd and so on - when 
i can tell that "call /scripts/backup-efi.sh" after you are done my ESP 
partitions on both drives are always in sync

and no the 1:1000000 chance that a crash happens between isn't relevant 
because the whole kenel-install/initrd dance isn't atomic at it's own
