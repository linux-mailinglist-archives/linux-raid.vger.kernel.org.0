I don't think this is specific to raid ...

It's not. It's sensitive to the fact that ANY disk is missing.

When a component of a raid disappears without warning, the raid will 
refuse to assemble properly on next boot. You need to get at a command 
line and force-assemble it.

And here is at least part of your problem. If the mount fails, systemd 
will halt and chuck you into a recovery console. I had exactly the same 
problem with an NTFS partition on a dual-boot system.

Is root's home on /Daten? It shouldn't be.
