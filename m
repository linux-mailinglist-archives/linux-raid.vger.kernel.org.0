The LSI should be a good controller as long as you the HBA fw and not
the raid fw.

I use an LSI with hba + the 8 AMD chipset sata ports, currently I have
12 ports cabled to hot swap bays but only 7+boot disk used.

How many recording do you think you will have and how many
clients/watchers?  With the SSD handling the writes for recording my
disks actually spin down if no one is watching anything.

The other trick the partitions let me do is initially I moved from 1.5
-> 3tb disks (2x750 -> 4x750) and once I got 3-3tbs in I added the 2
more partitions raid6(+1.5TB) (I bought the 3tb drives slowly), then
the next 3tb gets added to all 4 partitions (+3TB).

On reads at least each disk can do at least 50 iops, and for the most
part the disks themselves are very likely to cache the entire track
the head goes over, so a 2nd sequential read likely comes from the
disk's read cache and does not have to actually be read.  So several
sequential workloads jumping back and forth do not behave as bad as
one would expect.  Write are a different story and a lot more
expensive.  I isloate those to ssd and copy them in the middle of the
night when it is low activity.  And since they are being copied as big
fast streams one file at a time they end up with very few fragments
and write very quickly.   The way I have mine setup mythtv will find
the file whether it is on the ssd recording directory or the raid
recording directory, so when I mv the files nothing has to be done
except the mv.
