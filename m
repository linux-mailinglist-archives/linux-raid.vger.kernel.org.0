Right, the UEFI firmware would not be able to read an EFI partition 
inside a partitioned software RAID array, and even on most unpartitioned 
RAID arrays. The most you can do is create a RAID1 array with superblock 
1.0 and use it all as an EFI partition but registering EFI boot entries 
for each EFI RAID member will be tricky.

For redundancy, of course.

Without any redundancy. What is the point of setting up RAID1 for all 
the rest and see your system crash pitifully when a drive fails because 
half of the swap suddenly becomes unreachable ?

Yes, RAID arrays should be partitionable by default. But your installer 
may not support it. LVM over RAID may be more widely supported.

That sounds sensible. A RAID array with several partitions on the same 
drive does not make much sense. You must create a RAID array for each 
partition set.
