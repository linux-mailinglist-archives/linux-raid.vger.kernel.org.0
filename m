Yup. If your old system is full (or even if it isn't), if you're moving 
a straight partition on to raid, it's easier just to create all your 
slices new on the new system and move across.

If you really want to re-use the old drive, then you've got some maths 
ahead of you ...

You need to allocate the planned partition to your raid.
Then you create the raid, telling it to only use a space equal or less 
than your original disk.
Then you copy your original filesystem into the raid, except it probably 
doesn't quite fit, so you have to shrink it (not a simple matter) or use 
cp or rsync instead, equally unpleasant.
Then you wipe your old drive and add it as the new raid member.

It's probably not hard. But it's got vastly more scope for error, 
cock-up, fat-finger, or plain hardware hiccup. Is it worth it ...

Yup again. You're better off just putting in a new 256GB.

Then you can just dd your old root (and whatever else) filesystem(s) 
across, and grow them into the new space.

Plus your old drive is now just sitting there as a backup.

As my wife says about my driving, she trusts me, but there are too many 
idiots out there. Advice is *ALWAYS* partition your hard drive. raid 
couldn't care, but there are too many idiots out there that assume an 
unpartitioned drive is empty, and will stomp on it without asking. It's 
fallen off, but probably the biggest single cause of raid recoveries 
here is "something overwrote my superblock with a partition table" or 
the like - it's usually partition-related ...
