An obvious first step is to run lsdrv. 
https://raid.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Asking_for_help

That will hopefully find anything there.

But before you do anything BACKUP BACKUP BACKUP. It's only 250GB from 
what I can see - getting your hands on a 500GB or 1TB drive shouldn't be 
hard, and a quick stream of the partition shouldn't take long (although 
a "cp -a" might be safer, given that LUKS is involved ...).

Cheers,
