which should have been on the old RAID10 too :-)

anways, two pairs of identical machines and after one is done partition 
table can be cloned

so i should be good with +30716930M

2 MB extra size - i have 3 MB unpartitioned space on the end of the 2TB 
disks and will make boot 400MB instead 500MB to get some headroom :-)

in software outputs it often still is

well, on the other hand one could expect to store 1TB data on a 1TB 
drive.... with 100 GB drives the doifferences wasn't that large but 
these days....

one of my storage servers has a 6.8T ext4 FS on a 4x4TB RAID10 and 8 
versus 6.8..... :-)
