The EFAX had me worried a moment, but these are 12TB Reds? That's fine.
A lot of the smaller drives are now shingled, ie not fit for purpose!

Debian 10 - I don't know my Debians - how up to date is that? Is it a
new kernel with not much backports, or an old kernel full of backports?

What version of mdadm?


That said, everything looks good. There are known problems - WITH FIXES
- growing a raid 5 so I suspect you've fallen foul of one. I'd sort out
a rescue disk that you can boot off as you might need it. Once we know a
bit more the fix is almost certainly a rescue disk and resume the
reshape, or a revert-reshape and then reshaping from a rescue disk. At
which point, you'll get your array back with everything intact.

Cheers,
Wol
