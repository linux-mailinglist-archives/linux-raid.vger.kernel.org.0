i don't blame anybody

"BootLoaderSpec" is supposed to fix all the mess around UEFI and bootloaders

because that will be the default for everyone in the future

initramfs execution is completly irrelevant for the topic

the issue "my primary drive died and i need to boot from the second 
drive" is solved - period

nobody gives a shit about runtime stuff probably written to the ESP when 
a drive dies - the only question at that moment is "does my machine boot 
regulary after one of both drives died and can i start a RAID-rebuild 
from my normal environment and continue my work"
