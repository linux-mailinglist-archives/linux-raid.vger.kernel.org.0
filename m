Hi Xiao,
Thanks for taking care of this.

Container name is collected with 'create' flag set, so it's
name is additionally copied to static memory to prevent
overwrites. Could you verify?


So summarizing: the previously returned value might be lost
in next call.

I looked into code, map_dev_preffered() mainly is used for
determining short-life buffers, which are used only to the next
call (next call overwrites previous result, expect case you fixed).

IMO map_dev_preffered() cannot be trusted now. I see some options:
1 - allocate additional memory and save return value there (caller
needs to free it later).
2 - describe limitations in description of the function to avoid
incorrect usages in the future.

Your patch fixes only one place. Please go forward and analyze all
map_dev_preffered() calls (which looks safe to me). Maybe this
function can be replaced at all and we can drop this code in
flavor of devid2kname() or other.

Yeah, I know that it is used in Detail this way, but please  determine
way to replace this ugly [d*2] and [d*2+1].

This whole block should be moved from Detail() code to separate
function, which determines if device or replacement is in sync.

Thanks,
