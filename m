My first idea was to rewrite it at all but there is more nits
(like --name parameter and config). It is not a task for rc stage.

Just wanted to use one size for names, i understand that it can be too big
so if you have other proposal, let me know.

With malloc, I will need to add free() everywhere, I don't think
that it is good option.
I agree that this check can be removed, especially that now it is
always called with size 1024.

We need to return mdfd too, so cannot return from here.

First we need to determine how it should work.
The code now is quite unpredictable but it is working for
years. I just tried to fix static code analysis errors for
now. My concerns are here:
#mdadm -CR /dev/mdx --name=test ...
#mdadm -CR name --name=test ...
#mdadm -CR /dev/md/name --name=test ...

We can define volume by *dev and *name (--name=) and it
is not well defined how it should behave. I will need
to start with determining it first and later adapt
other stuff (assemble and incremental).

So, it requires separate discussion and will
be a release blocker.

Thanks,
Mariusz
