For now, raid5 journal and PPL feature are both required PAGE_SIZE == 4096.
(Seen r5l_init_log() and ppl_init_log() return -EINVAL when PAGE_SIZE is not
4096). So, in theory, this patch set should not make any different for them.

But, run tests is also necessary. Tests under mdadm git repository have two
journal cases: 21raid5cache and 20raid5journal. To test PPL, I write a simple
test case: create raid5 array with option '-k ppl'. mkfs and mount the array.
Then, some read and write data test on mount directory. Concurrently remove disk
from array and re-add it. Not found obvious errors.

Thanks,
Yufen
