Yes, 4K offset.  Yes, that dd command will get what you want it to.
It hardly matters what the superblock should looks like, because it
won't be there.  The thing you want to know is: what is there?
i.e.  you see random bytes and need to guess what they mean, so you can
guess where they came from.
Best to post the "od -x" output and crowd-source.

Are you sure the partition starts haven't changed? Was the array made of
whole-devices or of partitions?

If you want to find out if the superblock got moved, the maybe searching
for the magic number is best.
Look a the start of super1.c in mdadm.  The first 4 bytes of the
superblock are 0xa92b4efc little-endian.  So: FC 4E 2B A9
The next 4 bytes as 01 00 00 00 ( the major version)
Then the feature map - possibly 0.  Then 4 zero bytes.

If you see something that looks like that, it worth trying to point
mdadm at it.  Create a loop device over the it with an appropriate
offset, and ask mdadm --example to look at it.

I would suggest creating some sparse files the same size as the device,
create loop devices over them, and creating the array in the sequence
you remember doing it - using "--assume-clean" to avoid rebuilds that
would make those sparse files less sparse.
Then look at the metadata written and assume it is will similar to
that which was written to your array.
