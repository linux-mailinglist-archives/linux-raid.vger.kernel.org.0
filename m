Agreed.  It certainly doesn't fit the DM model.  We'd considered doing a non-DM
version of this (maybe "ubd"), but decided to stick with dm-user because we
didn't want to duplicate all the device creation stuff that DM provides.  A
simple version of that wouldn't be that hard to do, but the DM version has a
lot of features and we get that all for free.  We essentially decided to run
with DM until it gets in the way, and the only sticking point we ended up with
was that REQUEUE stuff (though not sure how that would show up with a bare
block device) and that scheduler question.

I'm going to stick with DM for now, unless it gets in the way, to avoid coming
up with a device creation scheme myself.  In the long term it's probably best
to have this be a standalone thing, but I don't want to dump a bunch of time
into putting that stuff together only to find that this isn't interesting
enough from a performance perspective to stick around.
