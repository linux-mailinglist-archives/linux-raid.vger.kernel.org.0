Hello Tomas,
What is the command you used to get this? I cannot match it with any
mdadm's output.

Blind guess is a "replacements" feature. I know, that MD/mdadm
allocates two slots for same device (n, n+1) to provide replacement
feature i.e. automatically replace old drive when recovery of new
one finished. So, you are still using old drive in this time but you are
preparing replacement drive in the same time.

The behavior may have logical explanation :)

First, please note that growing RAID1 to 2 drives is:
- adding one drive;
- extending metadata, new disk is "out-of-sync";
- performing "recovery" (not reshape!) for new disk.

0xFFFF is known to mean "faulty" (empty) in MD/mdadm. As I said, I
think this one to be slot for replacement. IMO it means that
replacement drive is missing. It is fine then.

roles[0] - DEVICE_NUMBER=0
roles[1] - DEVICE_NUMBER=1 (replacement slot for DEVICE_NUMBER=0)
roles[2] - DEVICE_NUMBER=2 (new drive)

I'm still not sure where these properties comes from. I looked for
"DEVICE_" in all code with no success..

Anyway, I hope it is helpful. Good luck.

Thanks,
Mariusz
