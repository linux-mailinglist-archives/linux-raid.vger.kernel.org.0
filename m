I get your point. That seems wrong to me. I wonder whether the kernel 
has some interface to gather information on partitions on a device. 
After all, the kernel knows lots of partition table types (mbr, gpt, ...)

I just checked. My disks don't have a GPT backup at the end. I might 
have converted an MBR partition table to a GPT. That would not create a 
backup GPT if the space is already occupied by a partition.

That said, for the sake of argument, I might just as well be using an 
MBR partition table.

Hmm, I think I know what you mean.

I verified that my last partition ends at the last sector of the disc. 
Pretty sure that means it must have been an MBR PT once upon a time.

This is not about me. I'm not asking to support my case for the sake of 
having my system work. I already converted to metadata 1.2 and that 
fixed the issue regardless where the last partition ends.

It's a regression, in the sense that my system has worked for years and 
after an upgrade suddenly didn't. I'd like to prevent that the same 
happens to others. It was pretty scary, even though no data seems to 
have been lost.

Yes, I agree with you. That's why I migrated to 1.2 already.

Likely, the reason is outside of the mdadm binary but inside the mdadm 
repo. Arch Linux uses the udev rules provided by the mdadm package 
without modification. The diff on the udev rules between mdadm 4.2 and 
4.3 release is significant. Both invoke mdadm -If $name but likely the 
order has changed.

An investigation of that is still pending. I'm not an expert in udev 
debugging, and the logs don't show.

Would it be possible to have automated tests for incremental raid 
assembly via udev rules? I'm not an expert in udev though.


> Anyway, patches are always welcomed!

Still working on my udev debugging skills. But afterwards, I may very 
well prepare a patch.



Best,
