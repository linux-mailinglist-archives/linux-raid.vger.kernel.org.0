rsync works by rename-then-rewrite on a whole-file basis (it doesn't
just modify changed bits of files), so I'm afraid it's going to be
terribly inefficient for large slightly-changed files, with many
unchanging blocks CoWed nonetheless.

The right way to do a deduplicating backup is to use a deduplicating
backup system (borg, restic, bup, bupstash -- I swear by bup myself).
There's a really good list here: <https://github.com/restic/others>.
