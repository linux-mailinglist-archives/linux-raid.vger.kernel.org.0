The problem is that it's already broken. Take a single mirror. One drive ex=
periences a bad sector, fine, you have redundancy, so you read the data fro=
m the other drive and md flags the sector as bad. The drive two is replaced=
, you lose the data. The new drive will get flagged with the same sector nu=
mber as faulty, since the first drive has it flagged. So you replace the fi=
rst drive and during resync, it also gets flagged as having a bad sector. A=
nd so on.

Modern (that is, disks since 20 years ago or so) reallocate sectors as they=
 wear out. We have redundancy to handle errors, not to pinpoint them on dis=
ks and fill up not-so-smart lists with broken sectors that work. If md sees=
 a drive with excessive errors, that drive should be kicked out, marked as =
dead, but not interfere with the rest of the raid.
