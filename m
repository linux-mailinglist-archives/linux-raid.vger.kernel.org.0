Hi, all --

I have a 1T data drive (currently in use with data) that I'd like to
mirror with a pair of 500G drives striped together.  I'll be mirroring
two partitions, and I'll be striping partitions to ensure the correct
size, and my understanding is that I'll have to create the mirror on the
two new drives with half missing, mount it up, copy over the data, dump
the original disk, and add it as the other half of the mirror to sync.
If I've missed anything there, please let me know, but all of that
matches my Googling and I don't think I have any questions.

What I do wonder, and what I don't see in any searches since apparently
nobody talks about striping up half of a mirror, is if I should do
anything special with my two-disk RAID0 stripe.  I was gobsmacked at
the simplicity of RAID10 on only two drives by splitting each in half
and "flipping" one to maximize head movement performance.  Awesome! :-)
Are there any brilliant hacks for simple striping?  If I'm just putting
together two [not terribly large] disks, will I benefit from any other
funny stuff, or should I just stripe together two partitions -- each
half the size of my other drive, of course -- to make a "boring basic"
stripe and run with that?


TIA & HANW

:-D
