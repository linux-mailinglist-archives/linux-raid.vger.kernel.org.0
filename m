I do this to reduce the queue depth, you need to find the path to the
card to limit it to just the one card.  I have before reduced it even
lower.  The only advantage to letting the disk queue a few commands is
the disk MIGHT be able to merge 2 requests, though unless the requests
contain re-writes to the same sectors I would be surprised if any
merging ever gets done.

find /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:01.1/0000:10:00.0/ -name
"queue_depth" -exec /usr/local/bin/set_queue_depth 8 {} \;
find /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:01.1/0000:10:00.0/ -name
"nr_requests" -exec /usr/local/bin/set_queue_depth 16 {} \;

[root@bm-server .homeassistant]# cat /usr/local/bin/set_queue_depth
echo $1 > $2
