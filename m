Your Attention Is Needed

I write to inform you that we have already sent you $5,200.00 dollars through Western Union as we have been given the mandate to transfer your full compensation payment total sum of USD950,000.00 via western Union by this government.

I was calling your telephone number to give you the information through the phone but you did not pick up my calls throughout yesterday, even this morning. Now, I decided to email you the MTCN and sender name so that you will pick up this $5,200.00 to enable us to send another $5,200.00 today as you know we will be sending you only $5,200.00 per day.

Please pick up this information and run to western union to pick up the $5,200.00 and call me back to send you another payment today, My direct phone line is +229-61380-625 once you picked up this $5,200.00 today.
