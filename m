The only place to use "reshape" is that reshape is frozed before, and
echo "reshape" can continue the interrupted reshape. Of coures, echo
"idle/resync" can also continue the interrupted reshape.

The enum sounds good, and I thought about enum in kerenl as well,
currently resync/recovery/reshape/... status is determined by
combination of flags, which is hard to follow.

Sounds like a good plan, and looks like the first thing to do is to sort
out all the places to use sysfs api 'sync_action' in mdadm, then we'll
know to define the new helper(I just grep the case 'idle' for now).
