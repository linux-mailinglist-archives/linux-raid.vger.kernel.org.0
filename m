Please share the link to the tutorial so we can maybe shame that
person into fixing it.  Or removing it.

Yeah, I think you're out of luck here.  What kind of filesystem did
you have on your setup?  Were you using MD -> LVM -> filesystem stack?
Or just a raw filesystem on top of the /dev/md?  device?

If you have any information on your setup before you did this, then
you might be ok, but honestly, I think you're toast.
