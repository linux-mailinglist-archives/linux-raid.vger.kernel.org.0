I don't know :-( This is getting a bit out of my depth. But I'm 
SERIOUSLY concerned you're still futzing about with CentOS 7!!!

Why didn't you download CentOS 8.5? Why didn't you download RHEL 8.5, or 
the latest Fedora? Why didn't you download SUSE SLES 15?

Any and all CentOS 7 will come with either an out-of-date mdadm, or a 
Frankenkernel. NEITHER are a good idea.

Go back to the links I gave you, download and run lsdrv, and post the 
output here. Hopefully somebody will tell you the next steps. I will do 
my best.
