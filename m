No, EFI is not the root cause either. The root cause is carelessly 
storing stuff in the bootloader area as if it was part of the standard 
Linux filesystem. Guess what ? It is not. Even though the EFI partition 
contains a filesystem, it is not a part of the standard Linux filesystem 
and requires special consideration, just like the MBR, the post-MBR gap 
or the BIOS boot partition.

You can blame Fedora for this. I blame Debian for this. I praise Ubuntu 
for managing multiple EFI partitions at last, and I do not often praise 
Ubuntu, believe me.

Weird, the wiki mentions /boot/loader/entries/.

Aren't you confusing the initramfs execution and generation ?

But that's not enough, because other parts of the system may write to 
the EFI partition, so it does not completely solve the issue.
