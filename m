Windows is known to do this but it can just as well happen within Linux.
Hopefully no filesystem formatting took place...

This method is so useful there should be standard command in Linux 
to create and manage overlays; but there is none so you have to make do 
with the 'overlay manipulation functions' as shown in the wiki.

I summarized `mdadm --create` for data recovery here:

  https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/131927/30851

In addition you should remove the bogus GPT and MBR partition headers. 
You can use 'wipefs' for this task. (Test it with overlays first...)

  wipefs --all --types pmbr,gpt,dos /dev/...

You are lucky to have all the relevant `mdadm --examine` output, 
so you already know the correct data offset and only need to guess 
the correct order of drives.
