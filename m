I've heard assorted stories about sticking drives in the freezer to help 
them recover, and have personal experience of being given a drive that 
has "failed" and I've managed to recover. Firstly, do you have a new 4TB 
drive to recover to? My worry is trying to copy the drive with read 
errors may lead to even more trouble. I'd try and recover it with 
ddrescue, and see how much it can get back.

Secondly, I'm sure I've dealt with these people in the past, although I 
can't vouch for them ...

I didn't use them for recovering damaged kit, we just had a bunch of 
9-track backups, but no 9-track drive, so they dumped them to CD for us. 
 From a business p-o-v it wasn't expensive ... see if they've got an 
operation near you. Describe your problem in as much detail as you can, 
and see if they'll give you an estimate ...

Cheers,
Wol
