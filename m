Well, Phil Turmell (one of the best recovery guys here) has N300s as his 
"go to" drives. I trust his judgement :-)

When I did my search on X300s, they come over as being "fast 
high-performance desktop drives". And manufacturers have pretty much 
deleted ERC from desktop drives!

Given that these are CMR, though, I guess Toshiba thought "high 
performance, we need ERC to prevent disk hangs".

Whereas Barracudas were good desktop workhorse drives, and the 
BarraCudas are aimed at the same market. The BarraCudas are SMR, and 
presumably come with a big enough cache to guarantee decent desktop 
performance, but they aren't aimed at the performance market.

Good to know the X300s aren't going to drop people in it ...

Cheers,
Wol
