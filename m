Yeah, you are right. There is no error_handler. I missed that.
Now, I reviewed raid0 again.

With my change result won't be clear for raid0, it is correlated with IO.
When drive disappears and there is IO, then it could return -EBUSY,
raid0_make_request() may set MD_BROKEN first.
In there is no IO then 0 will be returned. I need to close this gap.
Thanks for your curiosity.

So, please tell me, are you ok with idea of this patch? I will send
requested details with v2 but I want to know if I choose good way to close
raid5 issue, which is a main problem.

Thanks,
Mariusz
