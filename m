Yes... what does that have to do with what I said?  My point was that as
long as you are IO bound, it doesn't make much difference between having
to read all of the disks in the stripe for a raid6 and having to read
some number that is possibly less than that for a raid10.  They both
take about the same amount of time as just writing the data to the new
disk.
