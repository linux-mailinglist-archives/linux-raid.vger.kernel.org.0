But then David is in an equal pickle - what happens if the backup 
contains errors that only get discovered when reading, not writing ... 
no, David's plan is just the same as yours, his "half a mirror" is your 
backup, they suffer the same advantages and disadvantages.

mdadm doesn't have a clue that the second device in your mirror is a 
raid0. As far as it is concerned you have two completely SEPARATE raids, 
a raid0-stripe, and a raid1-mirror.

So when reading from the mirror it should preferentially read from the 
raid0 because it's the faster device. Which means it WON'T put 
unnecessary mechanical wear on the 1TB device because it preferentially 
will only use it for writing. And because the layer above sees it as a 
1TB device, it won't be scattering writes all over the place. All three 
drives would see a "stream write to the mirror" as a stream write to the 
drive. A1,B1,A2,C1,A3,B2,A4,C2, ...

Cheers,
