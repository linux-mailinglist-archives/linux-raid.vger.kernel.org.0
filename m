FWIW I support the move for the reasons Mariusz outlines. Everyone
will, of course, have their own perosnal preferences based on
expeirences, etc (I for one am a HUGE fan of Gerrit over any other
review system).

An important thing to keep in mind is that course correction is always
possible and it can be hard to predict how changes may or may not play
out well without taking some risks.

Now, not making attempts to improve communcations and quality (given
of course that opinions will vary and all of them matter) I think is a
recipe for stagnation.

Just my 2 cents :)
