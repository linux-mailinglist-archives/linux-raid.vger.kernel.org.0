If you directory entries are large (lots of small files in a
directory) then the recovery of the missing data could be just enough
to push your array too hard.

find /<mount> -type d -size +1M -ls     will find large directories.

do a ls -l <largedirname> | wc -l and see how many files are in there.

ext3/4 has issues with really big directories.

The perf top showed just about all of the time was being spend in
ext3/4 threads allocating new blocks/directory entries and such.

How much free space does the disk show in df?
