Don't use 0.9, use 1.0.

Both of these put the superblock at the end, so the start of the array 
on disk is also the start of the data area. Which means you can bypass 
the raid (normally a bad idea, but here you need it).

Thing is, v0.x is deprecated, if it breaks it won't be fixed. v1.x is 
supported, all the x indicates is the location of the superblock, it's 
identical across all 1.x arrays.

1.0 is at the end, not necessarily a good idea. To be avoided where 
possible.

1.1 is at the start. Where any problems with a rogue partitioner will 
trample it. To be avoided.

1.2 leaves a 4K scratch space and puts the superblock after that. So it 
will survive most damage to the start of a partition. Recommended.

Cheers,
Wol
