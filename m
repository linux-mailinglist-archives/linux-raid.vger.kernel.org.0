Thanks Jan and Logan! I will apply this to md-next. But it may not make
6.4 release, as we are already at rc7.

How about we only do the optimization in this patch for spinning disks?
Something like:

        if (likely(conf->reshape_progress =3D=3D MaxSector) &&
            !blk_queue_nonrot(mddev->queue))
                logical_sector =3D raid5_bio_lowest_chunk_sector(conf, bi);

Thanks,
Song
