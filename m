Hi Song,

Thank you for your response.

This can never happen. The reason is that a superblock of a particular
device will never record about *itself* that it is Faulty. When a
device fails, we mark it as Faulty in memory, and then md_update_sb()
will skip updating the superblock of this particular device. I have
discussed this also many years ago with Neil[1].

Can you please comment whether you believe that treating event counter
difference 1 as "still up to date" is safe?

Thanks,
Alex.

Question:
When a drive fails, the kernel skips updating its superblock, and
updates all other superblocks that this drive is Faulty. How can it
happen that a drive can mark itself as Faulty in its own superblock? I
saw code in mdadm checking for this.
Answer:
It cannot, as you say. I don't remember why mdadm checks for that.
Maybe a very old version of the kernel code could do that.
