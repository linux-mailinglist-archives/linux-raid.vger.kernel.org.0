I don't think you've understood mine. Doesn't matter what the cache 
algorithm is, the whole point of caching is that - when reading - it is 
only a benefit if the different threads are reading THE SAME bits of 
disk. So if your 3 TVs and the PC are accessing different tv programs, 
caching won't be much use, as all the reads will be cache misses.

As for writing, caching can let you prioritise reading so you don't get 
stutter while watching. And it'll speed things up if you watch while 
recording.

But basically, caching will really only benefit you if (a) your cache is 
large enough to hold all your favourite films so they don't get evicted 
from cache, or (b) you're in the habit of watching while recording, or 
(c) two or more tvs are in the habit of watching the same program.

The question is not "how many simultaneous threads do I have?", but "how 
many of my disk i/os are going to be cache misses?" Your argument 
actively avoids that question. I suspect the answer is "most of them".

Cheers,
Wol
