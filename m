Assuming you are now suggesting 6 x 1TB in RAID10 with 2 mirrors (to get 
3TB usable) then you are still suffering from the 2 drive failures 
causing loss of all data (although potentially you can lose 3 with no 
data loss). In fact, you might be better off with RAID6 where you can 
lose ANY 2 drives (I haven't had enough coffee to work out probabilities 
on these things). Also, the OP advised their system can only support a 
maximum of 3 drives.

So, you say if I'm really paranoid about drive failures... but how does 
that improve the situation? If I was truly paranoid about drive 
failures, and not concerned with capacity, then I'd buy 6 x 2TB drives 
in RAID1 with 6 mirrors, allowing for any 5 drive failures with no data 
loss. Though I'm not sure anyone would really do that (or be that 
paranoid), as you are likely to have "other" hardware failures before 
you will have multiple (that many) drive failures before being able to 
replace and re-sync the drives. I would be looking at other options like 
DRBD to real-time sync to another machine, and have both machines with 
RAID1 x 3 or RAID1 x 2 rather than RAID1 x 4 or more.
