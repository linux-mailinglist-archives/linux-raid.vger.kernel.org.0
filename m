Appreciated.  Only reason I didn't include it initially is because it's a giant wall of text (which the other debugging info was anyway, so I should have just been proactive).

Anyway, it can now be found below, annotated with the failing drives first.

Thanks,

First 2 (sdg, sdh) are the "bad" drives which cause the md hangs when added to the array.  sdh looks particularly healthy to my reading of the output, but was still causing the issues.
