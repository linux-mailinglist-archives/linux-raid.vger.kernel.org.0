The sync_action can handle multiple access. In fact all sys files can
handle such races. And we should think about backward compatibility as
we talked. It's better to keep the original meaning of these scripts
themselves. start_check kicks off the check and start_continue is used
to continue the check if the check can't finish.

The reason is mentioned above about backward compatibility. If it's a
new function, I totally agree with you. But the two services have run
for many years on many machines. So can you fix this problem based on
the two services and mark mdcheck_continue as deprecated? And we can
remove mdcheck_continue in future.
