Same here, though with different backup tools

I like this, three way mirrors are cheap insurance.

There's the problem, USB connections are notoriously crappy.  It would
be better to go with eSATA or some other more reliable transport.

What did you see in the logs?  I.e. did you kick off the logs and then
maybe send the logs to another system (if possible) or to the console
which you could then switch the display to, so you might have a chance
of looking at things?

I suspect your external USB enclosure is crap.  I've never found a
good one in my experience.  It's too prone to losing connectivity, or
having a crappy controller chip which just doesn't handle long term
writes well, etc.

It's the USB connection, not the disk or RAID.

Logs?  Warnings?  

Glad to hear it's up, but in the future, just use eSATA or regular
SATA in your case.  I've got some old big cases with 8 drive bays for
3.5" disks and it works great.  I've thought about server case with
2.5" disks that could be hot-swapped, but in reality for a home
system, I don't need it up five 9s, I can handle downtime.  

But thanks for the anecdote!
