What you need to do is revert the reshape. I know what may have 
happened, and what bothers me is your kernel version, 3.10.

The first thing to try is to boot from up-to-date rescue media and see 
if an mdadm --revert works from there. If it does, your Centos should 
then bring everything back no problem.

(You've currently got what I call a Frankensetup, a very old kernel, a 
pretty new mdadm, and a whole bunch of patches that does who knows what. 
You really need a matching kernel and mdadm, and your frankenkernel 
won't match anything ...)

Let us know how that goes ...

Cheers,
Wol
