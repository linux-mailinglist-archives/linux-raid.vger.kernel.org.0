Hi Laurence,
Please provide what OS you are using. I think that all you need is in upstream:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/utils/mdadm/mdadm.git/commit/?id=75350d87c86001c47076e1f62478079bdc072223
but your mdadm has no support yet. Please consider updating mdadm or OS.

Please kindly note that what you are trying to use is a desktop RST family
software raid. Implementation in Linux is for VROC (formerly RSTe, enterprise
raid solution). Metadata format used by both solution is same, that is why
Linux is able to understand it but since both product has been separated many
years ago, there could be differences. Officially, we are not supporting such
configurations.

Thanks,
Mariusz
