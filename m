Roger,

   Thanks for the details on your SSD setup. Yes, mythtv is supposed to 
find the file from storage group entries regardless of the actual 
location and thus mv is all that is required. However, I have never 
tried to use this feature though. So, it will be a new thing for me.  
Like I said before, I will try the LVM cache and see my disk activities 
are better. If that is not to my satisfaction, I will remove the cache 
and add it differently like you have. I only have a 500GB SSD, but I do 
not think daily recording will be anywhere close to that size.

Regards
Ramesh
