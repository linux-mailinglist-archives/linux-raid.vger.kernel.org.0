It's easy and in the man page. Several options actually. I typically use:
mdadm --examine --scan > <output file>
I than check the outputfile, if i agree add it to the distro mdadm.conf 
and re-generate the initrd/initramfs or however the distro calls it.

As i often have my boot disk on an array, i want predictability... thus 
i use mdadm.conf in the initrd.

Without mdadm.conf there is no predictability, as order of disk 
detection can, and sometimes indeed does, change.

mdadm.conf is your friend :)

This is the start of a philosophical discussion. In other words, 
different minds have different preferences.

nope. The suggestion here is to define the raids you need in mdadm.conf, 
and then disable auto-creation to prevent surprises from temporarily 
connected disks.
