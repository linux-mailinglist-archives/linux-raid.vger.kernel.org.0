you should do that for about 20 years anyways, no matter RAID or not

but how often is anything changed there?

my mdadm.conf is from 2011 and it's not even the same machine with my 
disks which are in the meantime replaced by SSD

you need to make sure that the current config is part if the initrd 
(dracut -f as example) which happens anyways when the kernel is updated 
and a new initrd is generated for the new kernel

---------------------

[root@srv-rhsoft:~]$ lsinitrd | grep mdadm
-rw-r--r--   1 root     root          315 Aug 16  2014 etc/mdadm.conf

---------------------

[root@srv-rhsoft:~]$ cat /etc/mdadm.conf
MAILADDR root
HOMEHOST localhost.localdomain
AUTO +imsm +1.x -all

ARRAY /dev/md0 level=raid1 num-devices=4 
UUID=1d691642:baed26df:1d197496:4fb00ff8
ARRAY /dev/md1 level=raid10 num-devices=4 
UUID=b7475879:c95d9a47:c5043c02:0c5ae720
ARRAY /dev/md2 level=raid10 num-devices=4 
UUID=ea253255:cb915401:f32794ad:ce0fe396
---------------------

"localhost.localdomain" is intentional, there is a second machine with 
identical UUIDs all over the place cloned by move two disks, resync on 
both and adjust runtime config like networking and so on

devices are always a problem because it's unknown when they appear, it's 
even unknown *if* they appear so nothing can wait for them

that's why you should always work with UUID
