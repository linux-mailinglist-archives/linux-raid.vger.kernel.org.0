given that it comes up with both md2 and md3 reporting 2 active, and 
working, devices, and /proc/mdstat looking good, I'd just try mounting 
the two arrays and seeing if they work!

THEN JUST GET THE DATA OFF.

All being well, it's just a faulty cage. But sticking WD Greens in a 
raid? That's not recommended!

The worst case is WD's trying to fix things might have re-initialised 
the array.

See if you can mount the array, and take it from there.

(Note your tray is USB, try to minimise i/o - I know I know copying off 
the drives will hammer it - because usb and raid don't like each other)

Cheers,
Wol
