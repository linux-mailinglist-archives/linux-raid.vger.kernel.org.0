better safe than sorry

in the past 15 years i replaced 6 drives on 8 machines (each 4 disks) 
while some are running since 2011

on every location with machines i am resposible for is at least one 
replacment disk, switch, order a new reserve disk, case closed

my backup scheme is perfect but my personal lifetime is much more worth 
than a disk costs these days - the backups are regulary testet and in 
the past 20 years i didn't need them which is a good thing

no backup on this planet contains the last 30 minutes of work besides 
that outtakes typically happen in the moment where you have no time to 
deal with such events

come on a restore a backup in a production environment, your customers 
will be not much thankful when they lose the last 30 minutes of all 
mails and work....
