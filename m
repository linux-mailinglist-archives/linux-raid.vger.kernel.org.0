It does make sense, but have you read the code to see if it already does it?

And if it doesn't, someone's going to have to write it, in which case it 
doesn't make sense, not to have that as the default.

Bear in mind that rebuilding the array with a new drive is completely 
different logic to doing an integrity check, so will need its own code, 
so I expect it already works that way.

I think you've got two choices. Firstly, raid or not, you should have 
backups! Raid is for high-availability, not for keeping your data safe! 
And secondly, go raid-6 which gives you that bit extra redundancy.

Cheers,
