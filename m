Yes, but 1.2 is the default, so I assumed it.

On one hand other 1.x subversions do not have that 4-KiB space so I 
assume it is not used. Also the gap between the superblock and the data 
may be used to hold temporary stuff.

On the other hand ext* filesystems do not use the first sector either 
but mke2fs erases it anyway, wiping any existing boot sector.

Anyway, as I wrote previously, no usable boot loader would fit there, so 
the point is moot.
