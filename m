Hi Gianluca,

If the setting is there, why wouldn't you use it? If the error
recovery is always very fast, as you hypothesise, then the low
timeout you set with smartctl -l scterc will never be reached
anyway.

I don't know what the typical error recovery behaviour of an SSD is
because in years and years I haven't seen such problems with SSDs,
but where they offer the scterc setting I do use it anyway on the
basis of it's not going to hurt anything.

I see it available on enterprise SSD like Samsung SM883, Intel
D3-S4610. I don't see it on Supermicro DOM modules.

I also don't see it on NVMe drives at all (e.g. Samsung PM983), and
NVMe seems to be the future of flash so maybe this setting dies
soon…

Cheers,
Andy
