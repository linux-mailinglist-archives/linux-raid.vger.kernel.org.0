Barracuda ... DO NOT USE THIS IN A PARITY RAID ARRAY !!!

Mirroring as you plan here is okay.

Caviar Green ??? Caviars should be okay, but the "green" moniker makes
me nervous. Check SCT/ERC, but striping/mirroring will be fine.

Okay, the simple approach.

Create a single-device mirror using the 1TB and the special device
"missing". Copy everything across and make sure it's all okay. (I'm
assuming you can safely wipe this drive as it has nothing on it you wish
to keep.)

Create a striped device using the two 500GB drives.

Add the striped device to the 1TB mirror.

Plan to replace all the disks with something like Seagate Ironwolves or
Toshiba N300s in the near future :-)

Read especially the page on timeout mismatch as this DOES apply to your
Barracuda !!!
