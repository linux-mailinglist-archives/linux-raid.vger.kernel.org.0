Yes, I have 2x500GB ssds for cache. May be, I should do raid1 on them 
and use as cache volume.
I thought SSDs are more reliable and even when they begin to die, they 
become readonly before quitting.Â  Of course, this is all theory, and I 
do not think standards exists on how they behave when reaching EoL.
