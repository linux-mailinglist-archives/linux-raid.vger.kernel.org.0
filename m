Linear tacks one drive on to the end of another. Raid-0 stripes across 
all drives. Both effectively combine a bunch of drives into one big drive.

Striped gives you speed, a big file gets spread over all the drives. The 
problem, of course, is that losing one drive can easily trash pretty 
much every big file on the array, irretrievably.

Linear means that much of your array can be recovered if a drive fails. 
But it's no faster than a single drive because pretty much every file is 
stored on just the one drive. And depending on what drive you lose, it 
can wipe your directory structure such that you just end up with a 
massive lost+found directory.

That's why there's raid-10. Note that outside of Linux (and often 
inside) when people say "raid-10" they actually mean "raid 1+0". That's 
two striped raid-0's, mirrored.

Linux raid-10 is different. it means you have at least two copies of 
each stripe, smeared across all the disks.

Either version (10, or 1+0), gives you get the speed of striping, and 
the safety of a mirror. 10, however, can use an odd number of disks, and 
disks of random sizes.

Cheers,
Wol
