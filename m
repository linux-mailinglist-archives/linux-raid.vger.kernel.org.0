I wouldn't think it necessary to scrap the array, but if you've backed 
it up and are happier doing so ...

AIUI it was an external program squeezing in where it shouldn't that 
(quite literally) threw a spanner in the works and jammed things up. The 
array itself should be perfectly okay.

As for the "invalid backup" problem, you should never have given it a 
backup in the first place, and (while I don't know the code) I very much 
expect it ignored the option completely. You have superblock 1.2, which 
has a chunk of space "reserved for internal use", one of which is to 
provide this backup.

The only real good reason I can think of for scrapping and recreating 
the array is that it will give you a clean array, with ALL THE CURRENT 
DEFAULTS. This is important if anything goes wrong in future, if you 
have an array with a known creation date, that has not been "messed 
about" with since, it's easier to recover if you're really stupid and 
damage it and lose your records of the layout. Once an array goes 
through reshapes, it can be a lot harder to work out the layout if you 
have to rescue the array by recreating it.

Cheers,
Wol
