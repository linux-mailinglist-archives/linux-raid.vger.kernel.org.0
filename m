Hmm...

Which backs up what I thought - if it's used by the dm people to call 
md-raid, then asking for info/comments about it on the md list is likely 
to get you no-where...

Yup. I've never understood it. But, from all my time on the list, it is 
noticeable that nobody seems to know or care much about dm, and this is 
simply one more data point that agrees with that impression. If you want 
to know about dm-raid, you probably need to go where the dm people hang out.
