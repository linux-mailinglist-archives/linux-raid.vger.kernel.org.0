The tuen2fs'es are setting changes only and are designed to be
reversible and non-destructive.

You could note the stride value, umount, make the change, and remount
and see if that fixes the issue and that would expected to be safe.

If something went wrong (about all I have ever seen go wrong is some
of the settings need the fstab entry changed and/or cannot be turned
off for all fses of the same type (ie ext2/3 and be turned off but not
ext4) so are invalid and fail the mount until you revert the setting
with tune2fs), you umount, but the stride setting back and remount.
