/efi/boot (a) must be fat32, and (b) must be a "top level" partition. 
Okay, that's not totally true, but near enough, and scuppers your plan 
straight off ...

swap - why mirror it? If you set the fstab priorities to the same value, 
you get a striped raid-0 for free.

/tmp - is usually tmpfs nowadays, if you need disk backing, just make 
sure you've got a big-enough swap (tmpfs defaults to half ram, make it 
bigger and let it swap).

Should be able to, but as above for your first array it won't actually 
work ...

Well. I'm using lvm, it's normal practice, but again won't work for your 
first array ...

/boot/efi on its own partition

swap - its own partition

/tmp - tmpfs

/ (including /var and /usr) on one array

/home on the other array

I've not done it, it's on my list of things to try, but you could put 
/boot/efi on v1.0 superblock raid-1 array and format it fat32. Make sure 
you know what you're doing!

That basically leaves swap and /tmp as your only unprotected partitions, 
neither of which is expected to survive any computer problems intact 
anyway (swap depends on your current session, and/tmp is *defined* as 
volatile and lost on shutdown.

My setup only has the one (raid-5) array for all my "real" partitions, 
and I've got lvm to give me / and /home (and others). It also gives me 
some degree of backup capability, as I just take snapshots. Running 
gentoo, that gives me security when I update the system every weekend :-)
