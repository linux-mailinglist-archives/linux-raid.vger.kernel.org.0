Yeah, efifs might have it

One solution is making the ESP static, other than OSLoader updates. A
"stub" grub.cfg points to $BOOT/grub/grub.cfg or $BOOT/grub2/grub.cfg,
where $BOOT is typically mounted at /boot; and then follow the Boot
Loader Spec to add drop-in configuration files for each menu entry.
Typically there is one drop in file per kernel. This is how Fedora has
worked for several releases now. It permits the two grub.cfg's to
remain static, is less prone to problems if replacing it or modifying
it is interrupted by a crash. And the snippets are a more user
friendly format for editing, should it be deemed necessary, while
being less fragile.

A canonical ESP that resides virtually in /usr I think is another way
of doing all of this; and use a service unit to sync from /usr to each
ESP by mounting them e.g. somewhere in /run, in sequence, thereby
containing any problems with interruptions.

https://systemd.io/BOOT_LOADER_INTERFACE/
https://systemd.io/BOOT_LOADER_SPECIFICATION/

While some platforms are currently left out of the specs, I think it's
better to grow the spec to make booting more reliable and a lower
maintenance burden rather than continuing to do things in a rather ad
hoc manner.
