I see no value either.
What if someone will add new error definition to errno? Should we change our
enum start then? I think that nobody will notice it until issue but it is
unlikely too. For that reason I think that it is pointless from the beggining
because we are defnining rule which won't be honored later.

I think that we can just to redefine errno codes in enum if they are needed. We
are free to change particular enum constant value to make room for errno
compatible codes if there will be need to. That should be safe if some code
does not have ugly trick like calling external function and comparing it with
enum constant:

*/ let's say that SUCCESS is 0 */
if (strncmp(arg, arg1, arg2) == ENUM_STATUS_SUCCESS)

but it is our job to catch it on review so we are safe here, right? :)

Thanks,
Mariusz
