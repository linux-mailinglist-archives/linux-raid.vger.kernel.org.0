The history of my GitHub PR probably confused you. Sorry for that.

The first version of the PR on GitHub ("combine mdcheck_start and
mdcheck_continue into a single service") actually removed one of the
services.=C2=A0But I'd changed that in the 2nd version on Aug 21st [1].

[1] https://github.com/md-raid-utilities/mdadm/pull/190#event-19274907168

I'd realized that this was problematic in terms of backward
compatibility.=C2=A0Removing or renaming systemd services in a package
update is almost impossible do properly for distributions. Being a
distribution person myself, I didn't want to cause needless trouble for
myself and fellow distro people ;-)

Moreover, I'd started to think my first approach wasn't elegant. It had
big backward compatibility issues, much more than the current version.

> race come up again?

It would only come up again if a user modified the timer schedule such
that mdcheck_start.service was again started before
mdcheck_continue.service on the same day. That's possible, but not
likely, and we could blame the user if it happened.

OTOH, my approach in this patchset would have completely avoided this
sort of race.

No. Checks that haven't been finished yet would continue normally. With
this set, mdcheck_start.service would just delete the markers that
inhibit starting new checks.

Consider two arrays A and B. A has finished checking, B has not. So
under /var/lib/mdcheck, you'd have files "MD_UUID_$B" and "Checked_$A".

* On a "normal" day, only mdcheck_continue.service would run and
continue the check for B. Nothing would happen for A.

* On a "monthly" day, mdcheck_start.service runs first and deletes
"Checked_$A". When mdcheck_continue.service starts later, it will
continue checking B at the position saved in "MD_UUID_$B", and start
checking A from position 0.

Anyway, I've already closed this PR and I'll send a new one that keeps
the services as they used to be.=C2=A0If I've convinced you of this set now=
,
let me know :-)

Otherwise I'll just send a minimal new PR without the controversial
patch.
