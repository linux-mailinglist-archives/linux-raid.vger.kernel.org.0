Except that is not what I said. I said the risk is increased for each 
read required. I didn't say that you *will* experience a read failure. 
It's all about reducing risks without increasing costs to the point that 
there is no benefit gained. Your costs and benefits will differ from the 
next person, so there is no single answer that matches for everyone. 
Some people will say they need a minimum of triple mirror RAID10, others 
will be fine with RAID5 or even RAID0.

It sounds like you are trying to say that regardless of how many reads 
are required you will never experience a read failure? That doesn't seem 
to match what the manufacturers are saying.

Adam
