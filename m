Hi Neil,

I guess my mindset is more that I don't expect RHEL/SLES grade distros
to fully upgrade mdadm, but I do see them backporting changes occasionally.

I was mostly basing my question on what I see us testing for in the
actual code. Dropping support for anything prior to SLES 12 (4.12) and
RHEL 8 (kernel 4.18) seems fair.

Cheers,
Jes
