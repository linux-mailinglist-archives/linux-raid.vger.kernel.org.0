Because that means that distros need to know all about EVERY OTHER

I don't know who's fault it was, probably Microsoft's, but I gave up 
trying to dual-boot a laptop ...

I would agree with you. But that requires EVERY OS on the computer to 
co-operate. I think you are being - shall we say - optimistic?

Fact: Other systems outside of linux meddle with the EFI. Conclusion: 
modifying linux to sync EFI *at the point of modification* is going to 
fail. Badly.
