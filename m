No, I don't think so. I'm not sure, but aiui, there is a critical point
where the data is partially saved to disk, and should a power failure
occur at that precise point you have a stripe incompletely saved, and
therefore corrupt. This is why you need a log to fix it ...

Probably. Sod's law, you will have other files on the same stripe and
things could go wrong ... Plus I believe some file systems (including
ext4?) store small files in the directory, not as their own i-node, so
there's a whole bunch of other complications possible, plus if you
corrupt the directory ,,,

RULE 0: RAID IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR BACKUPS.

And if you don't want to lose live data as it is being updated, you need
a journal. Run the correct horse for the course :-)

Cheers.
