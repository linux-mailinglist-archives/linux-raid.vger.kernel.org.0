Because device will be claimed in userspace by mdadm. MD may check if device
is not claimed. I checked bind_rdev_to_array() and I don't find an obvious
answer, so I could be wrong here.

Maybe someone more kernel experienced can speak here? Song, could you look?

I think that the descriptor opened by incremental block kernel from adding =
the
device to the array but also the same incremental is able to add it later
because metadata is on device. There is no retry in Manage_add() flow so it
must be added by Incremental so the question is if it is already in
array or disk is just claimed and that is the problem.

Eventually, you can test your proposal that should gives us an answer.

Agree. Mdadm has this problem, descriptors are opened and closed may times.

Ok, there is an assumption in kernel that device MUST have metadata.

Yeah, I know but udev processes the disk, not MD device so the locking
should work. But if we cannot trust it, we shouldn't follow this idea.

Yeah, bad idea. Agree.

New day, new ideas:
- why we cannot let udev to add the device? just write metadata and finish,
  udev should handle that because metadata is there.

- incremental uses map_lock() to prevent concurrent updates, I seems to b
  missed for --add. That could be a key to prevent the behavior.Incremental=
 is
  checking if it can lock the map file. If not, it finishes gracefully. To =
lock
  array we need to read metadata first, so it goes to the first question- i=
s it
  a problem that incremental has opened descriptor?

Thanks,
Mariusz
