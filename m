Hi Guoqing,

Thanks for following up on this. I have a couple of questions.

So if I understand you correctly, this is a consequence of
raid10_read_request being reworked so that it can be called by
handle_read_error, but in my case it is not being called by
handle_read_error but instead raid10_make_request and is incorrectly
going down an error path and reporting a redirected read?

From my stack trace it seemed that it was just
raid10.c:__make_request that was calling raid10_read_request but I
could not see where in __make_request the r10_bio->devs[slot].rdev
was being set, enabling the above test to succeed. All I could see
was a memset to 0.

I understand that your patch makes it so this test can no longer
succeed when being called by __make_request, meaning that aside from
not logging about a redirected read it will also not do the
rcu_read_lock() / rcu_dereference() / rcu_read_unlock() that's in
that if block. Is that a significant amount of work that is being
needlessly done right now or is it trivial?

I'm trying to understand how big of a problem this is, beyond some
spurious logging.

Right now when it is logging about redirecting a read, does that
mean that it isn't actually redirecting a read? That is, when it
says:

Jan 11 17:10:40 hostname kernel: [1318773.480077] md/raid10:md3: nvme1n1p5: redirecting sector 699122984 to another mirror

in the absence of any other error logging it is in fact its first
try at reading and it will really be using device nvme1n1p5 (rdev)
to satisfy that?

I suppose I am also confused why this happens so rarely. I can only
encourage it to happen a couple of times by putting the array under
very heavy read load, and it only seems to happen with pretty high
performing arrays (all SSD). But perhaps that is the result of the
rate-limited logging with pr_err_ratelimited() causing me to only
see very few of the actual events.

Thanks again,
Andy
