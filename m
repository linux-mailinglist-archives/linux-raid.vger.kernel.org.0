It's when I was trying to make my yearly backup that I found out it was
corrupting. I have HDDs I backup to. When I backup, I erase the
previous year (as I don't have enough room otherwise), then backup the new
year. As a system, it worked up until now.

It assembles fine with all the disks, the problem is the data corruption
that has occurred across the members.

Everything is written down on paper.

Yes, that's my problem. I wanted to try and isolate the disk pairs so
that I could try and figure out if there is any pattern or differing
copies that would allow me to restore the corrupted data.

Searching online turned up raid6check.
https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/137384/raid6-scrubbing-mismatch-repair

But the people there also pointed out that Linux's raid repair operation
only recalculates the parity. I would have thought that it did a best of
3 option. I mean, that's a big part of why we have RAID6 instead of RAID5,
right?

I think you misunderstood my original question, how do I assemble the
RAID6 pairs (RO mode) into two different arrays such that I can read from
them simultaneously?

If I have to do some coding with respect to the mdadm utility, I'm
willing. But for all I know, the Linux Kernel might destroy all of my data
if I try something like that.

Thanks,
David
