Good to know. Thank you.

By the way, I had not set the partition labels when I installed on the new disks and I see that they became localhost:boot etc, all of the labels start with ”localhost:”

Is there any reason I cannot simply use gparted in CentOS to rename them, ie removing the ”localhost:” part” while keeping the second part of each label? I understand that could have been used in fstab but I have not done that.

Any other place they could potentially be used or is the renaming above safe?
