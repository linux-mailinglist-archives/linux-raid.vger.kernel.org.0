funny, 2 years ago as i came up with that after finding out the hard way
that my hybrid RAID10 don't work as expected nobody cared at all except
one guy which after some negative respone statet that he isn't a kernel
developer at all....

obiously that linux RAID10 is not a RAID10 as anywhere else now comes
with it's drawbaks and the optimizatiojs from the past for rotating
media becone a problem these days
