it would make sense but it's out of question the way mdadm is 
implemented today - just store the information without a proper usecase 
would make things only worser

the intentional design of mdadm is a pure RAID implementation on the 
device layer with no konwledge of the filesystem on top

everything you listed above has an answer and that's ZFS/BTRFS which has 
RAID-functionality by design as part of the FS and hence knows implcit 
that unused space don#t need to be mirrored

"skip the initial sync at array creation" - surely, would be nice, but 
the design is "we don't know what is stord in thea RAID, our job is that 
in RAID1 all mirros are identical at the phyiscal disk layer"
