Why use something as crude as parity? There's *lots* of space there. You
could store full-blown Reed-Solomon stuff in there in much less space
than parity would require with far more likelihood of repairing even
very large errors. A separate device-mapper target would seem to be
perfect for this: like dm-integrity, only with a separate set of
"error-correcting disks" rather than expanding every sector like
dm-integrity does.
