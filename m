I noticed a clear regression with mdadm tests with this patch in md-next
(7e6ba434cc6080).

Before the patch, tests 07reshape5intr and 07revert-grow would fail
fairly infrequently (about 1 in 4 runs for the former and 1 in 30 runs
for the latter).

After this patch, both tests always fail.

I don't have time to dig into why this is, but it would be nice if
someone can at least fix the regression. It is hard to make any progress
on these tests if we are continuing to further break them.
