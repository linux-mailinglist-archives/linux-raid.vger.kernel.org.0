i yet need to see an array with 6 different disks where 2 are failing at
the same time which in this case needs to be the two right ones making a
stripe-mirror.... at least you have decent write performance while a
RAID1 with 6 mirrors sucks

and about "OP advised their system can only support a maximum of 3
drives" i need to see that hardware - even the HP microservers have 4
slots and while my HP desktop from 2011 only "supports" 3 disks there
are adapters to place a 2.5" or 3.5" disk or in case of SSDs 4x2.5" in a
5.25 slot

the only hardware i ever seen with 3 slots are Apple X-Serve and i would
throw them away anyways but also any other box not support RAID10 at all
