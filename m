Wol, thanks for the reply.  What is a 0.9 layout?  I've never heard of
that before.  I'm confused about why to not mirror the boot partition.
Other articles I've read on the subject suggest doing this.  What is the
problem?

Now maybe we are having a communication problem mixing up the initial
UEFI partition (mounted at /boot/efi) which does get set up on each SSD
independently and is definitely NOT mirrored, and the actual boot partition
(mounted as /boot) which is where GRUB and kernel are installed.  If I
made one big mirrored / partition, /boot could just be included along with
everything else.

As I say, I'm just trying to avoid future problem from something that I
didn't anticipate from the start.

Regards,
