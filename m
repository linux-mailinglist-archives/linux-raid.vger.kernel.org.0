Hi Paul,

At some point Paul Luse and Song Liu decided that they will choose Github f=
or MD
CI and Paul is busy working on creating dedicated Github runners for MD CI.
Moving mdadm development then is a logical next step as I want to reuse the
prepared hardware resources simple way.

These are known limitations. I understand your objections here.

We have to accept them. Commits will be as good as maintainers cares about =
them.
Please keep in mind that except Intel, the activity around mdadm is low.
I'm receiving 1 patchset within 2 weeks. I can deal with those limitations =
and
I don't need customized and advanced solution with huge maintenance cost (at
least for now). If that will be changed- we will propose something else.

There are many Github actions we can setup to help us with review.

We cannot ban less experienced users from participating. I want to make mda=
dm
development more attractive. I know that generally folks here are well
experienced in Linux netiquette, having github will change that.

It is another trade-off I agree to take.

For young developers Github is natural work environment. If they want to to
fill issue (as they do for thousand other projects)- they can. If github md=
adm
maintainers cannot support them, we will redirect them to mailing list for
wider audience.

The true is that mdadm is a small and "simple" userspace project. There is =
not a
tons of development around it. Please help me keep simple things simple.
We can achieve CI, (probably) "sufficient" review system and simplified well
known on market participating process in few clicks. Maintenance of review
solution will not belong to us (expect custom GH runners).

For these reasons, I see it a natural next step to grow but I'm also famili=
ar
with Github limitations. I have to deal with them in other projects I'm
maintaining or participating.=20

I also know that I can count of support from Linux Foundation in case of sp=
ecial
needs (like additional resources). That is also great.

Thanks,
Mariusz
