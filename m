I think you've just put your finger on it. Multiple EFI partitions is 
outside the remit of linux, and having had two os's arguing over which 
was the right EFI, I really don't think the system manager - be it yast, 
yum, apt, whatever - is capable of even trying. With a simple 
configuration you don't have mirrored EFI, some systems have one EFI per 
OS, others have one EFI for several OSes, ...

At the end of the day, it's down to the user, and if you can shove a 
quick rsync in the initramfs or boot sequence to sync EFIs, then that's 
probably the best place. Then it doesn't get missed ...

Cheers,
Wol
