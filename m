Ok, now I get this. Thanks! It make sense now. And I know who made it this way:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/utils/mdadm/mdadm.git/commit/?id=cb8f5371352f6c16af5aab8a40861e13aa50fc2b

This second independent Manage_subdevs call is needed for external metadata
because at the end we need to remove the device from the container. It seems
that I made a mistake here and doubled call for native (nobody have been
noticed for years LOL). The goto end; should be independent from if (rv & 2).

Feel free to clear this up. I think that else branch is not needed now.
In incremental remove we should stay with 'I' disposition because in this mode
kernel should not be blocked from setting broken state as it is with 'f'
disposition.

It is fine, I read that at the morning so it seems that my brain was not
working yet. This is another example why I should not write mail before coffee
:)

Thanks,
