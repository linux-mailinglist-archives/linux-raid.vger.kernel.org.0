AFAIK, possible options:
1) always set lbs for arrays for new kernel, and backport the patch for
old kernels so that users can still assemble the array.(current option)
2) only set lbs by default for new array, for assembling the array still
left the lbs field unset, in this case the data loss problem is not fixed,
we should also print a warning and guide users to set lbs to fix the proble=
m,
with the notification the array will not be assembled in old kernels.
3) revert the new feature to set lbs for mdraids.
