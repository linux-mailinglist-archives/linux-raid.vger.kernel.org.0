Either way is fine. I have no objections to do this.

It is known problem, so far I know Nigel is looking at it. There is no
fix for now. Execution timed out and logs has not been copied for user
as expected.

Here you can see the Nightly report that is executed on top regularly
to at least determine if fails are persistent (probably not caused by
your change).

Sorry, it is not yet perfect but at least something :)

Thanks,
Mariusz
