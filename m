We'll see. For some reason it's not currently climbing, but I guess it's ju=
st night and it's not doing much. Zabbix is still complaining, but hell, it=
 might even be interesting :)

PS: As I mentioned, it's not my box. I just help out when something bad hap=
pens etc, such as a sudden drop to 200kB/s on one drive in the RAID (we sor=
ted that out and added some monitoring to zabbix for that as well - it's in=
 another thread in here).
