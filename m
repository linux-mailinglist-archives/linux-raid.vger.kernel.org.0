Hi Coly,

Having a real hardware with VROC support would be the most convenient
solution here. However, you could do a quick hack to overcome this
situation. That would be commenting out the line:
array_size =3D round_size_to_mb(array_blocks, data_disks);
in init_super_imsm_volume(). Then creating RAID in OS should have the
same size mismatch issues as size per drive won't be aligned to 1MiB
(considering you create raid with size not aligned to 1MiB) - raid
size created in EFI only has to be multiple of sector size and chunk
size.
Hope this helps you.

Thanks,
Lukasz
