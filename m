forget what you try to figure out, you can't control which two disks 
fail at the same time, period

you can minimize the risk by using different disk types and/or 
distribute their age (i am doing that currently by replacing all disks 
on a backup server with two weeks between)

in case of a frimware timebomb you have no chance in case of identical 
disks and when you seek a soluton whuch survives two failures then for 
the sake of god use one which is called RAID6 and not RAID10

that you can lose two disk in a RAID10 with luck is exactly that: LUCK - 
period
