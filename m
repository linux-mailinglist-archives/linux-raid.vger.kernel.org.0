Thanks for the explanation. I understand now. But I still have one question.

Now for a raid0, it can't remove one member disk from raid0. It returns
EBUSY and the raid0 still can work well. It makes sense. Because all member
disks are busy, the admin can't remove the member disk and mdadm gives a
proper error.

With this patch, it changes the situation. In raid0_error, it sets MD_BROKEN.
In fact, it isn't broken. So is it really good to set MD_BROKEN here? In patch
62f7b1989c0 ("md raid0/linear: Mark array as 'broken'...), MD_BROKEN
is introduced
when the member disk disappears and the disk is really broken. For raid0/linear,
the raid device can't work anymore.

Best Regards
Xiao
