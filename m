You don't say what the onboard controllers are, but in general, I
wouldn't expect any significant difference in throughput when using a
PCIe SATA add-in card vs. the onboard AHCI controller(s), except perhaps
when changing go a solution which uses battery-backed write cache
(depending on the workload).

If you need more I/O throughput from hard disk drives, then you might
want to look at something like bcache (especially if the alternative is
relying on the correct behaviour from proprietary raid implementations).

HTH,

Tim.
