Raid 10 across two drives? Do I read you right? So you can easily add a 
3rd drive to get 6TB of usable storage, but raid 10 x 2 drives = raid 1 ...

Changing topic slightly, if you have multiple slices per drive, raided 
(which I've done, I wanted /, /home and /var on their own devices), it 
is quite easy to lose just one slice. But that *should* be down to 
mis-configured devices. Get a soft-read error, the *linux* timeout kicks 
in, and the partition gets kicked out.

But that sort of problem should take no time whatsoever to recover from. 
With journalling or bitmap (you'll need to read up on the details) a 
re-add should just replay the lost writes, and you're back in business. 
So - if your aim is speed of recovery - there's no point splitting the 
disk into slices. There are good reasons for doing it, but that isn't 
one of them!

Cheers,
Wol
