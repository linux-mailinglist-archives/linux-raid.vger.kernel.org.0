Hi Christopher

Which superblock version do you use? If it's super1.1, superblock starts 
at 0 sector.
If it's super1.2, superblock starts at 8 sector. If it's super1.0, 
superblock starts at the
end of device and bitmap is before superblock. As mentioned above, 
bitmap is behind
the superblock, so it should not be super1.0. So I have a question why 
does 2056 hold
the superblock?

Regards
Xiao
