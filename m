Yes... but the older a kernel release is, the less testing it gets for
edge cases, and reshaping is an edge case that doesn't happen very
often. I'm not terribly surprised that nobody turns out to have been
testing it in this kernel line and that it's rusted as a consqueence.

(Reshaping in conjunction with systemd is probably even rarer, because
reshaping tends to happen when you run out of disk space and need more,
or when disks age out and need replacement, which means it happens on
fairly old, stable machines -- and probably, even now, most such old
machines aren't running systemd and aren't exercising the buggy code
triggered by that systemd unit file.)

The question isn't "full support", the question is "what gets a lot of
testing"? Recent, supported stable kernels get a lot of testing, so they
are likely to have exercised relatively obscure paths like this one.
