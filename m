I believe the question was not about the order of layers, but whether to
create a RAID with mdadm and then LVM on top, vs. abandoning mdadm and using
LVM's built-in RAID support instead:
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/6/html/logical_volume_manager_administration/mirror_create

Personally I hugely prefer mdadm, due to the familiar and convenient interface
of the program itself, as well as of /proc/mdstat.
