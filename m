Hmm ... so being pedantic about terminology that's a definite raid-1+0, 
not linux-raid-10.

And if I read you right, you have only 2 disks? Split into 4 partitions 
to give you 1+0? WHY!!! I thought the acronym was Keep It Simple S*****.

Linux and raid try to minimise head movement. So if your reads are all 
over the place, one head will gravitate to the end of its disk, while 
the other will gravitate to the start.

There's not much point messing around and changing it now, but if you 
need to increase the array size, I'd just ditch the fancy layout and 
move to a simple real linux-raid-10. Add a new 4TB to your raid-1 mirror 
and convert it to a true raid-10. You said you had plenty of spare 2TBs, 
so --replace one of your 4TBs onto a pair of 2TBs, then --replace one of 
your raid-0's onto it. Finally, just fail the other raid-0 then replace 
it with the last 4TB. That way you don't ever lose redundancy, despite 
just knocking one drive out.

Well, adding more disks will speed up access. And how much is a (cheap) 
SATA card? about £10?

Actually, that might be a good idea, especially if you want to get into 
playing with lvm? Especially if you can temporarily (or permanently) add 
a third 2TB. Free up a 4TB as before, make a single-disk mirror out of 
it, and create an LVM volume and partition. I'm hoping this partition 
will be big enough just to do a dd copy of your mirror partition across.

Or you could just do a cp copy, but my drives are littered with hard 
links so cp is not a wise choice for me ...

Then as before free up your second 4TB without actually destroying the 
array to keep redundancy, add it in to your new mirror, then you can 
just kill all the remaining disks on the old array. Then add two (or 
more) 2TBs into the new array. That'll give you 6TB of usable space with 
the first 4TB mirrored across 4 drives (you wanted speed?) and the last 
2TB mirrored across the second half of the two 4TB drives. If you can 
then add any more 2TB drives it'll add more disk space but more 
importantly from your point of view, it'll spread the data across even 
more drives and make large files read even faster ... Something to think 
about. Just a warning - you're supposed to be able to easily convert 
between raids, provided you go via a 2-disk mirror. Raid-10, however, 
seems to be rather tricky to get back into a raid-1 layout ... going to 
raid-5 or 6 or whatever (should you want to) might involve building a 
whole new array.

Cheers,
Wol
