Array is created by /sys/module/md/parameters/new_array if chosen_name has
certain form. For IMSM, when we are creating arrays using "/dev/md/name" or
"name" only create_on_open is used (if no "names=yes" in config). I
understand that it works with tests but I don't feel that it is complete yet.
Could you how it behaves when we use "whatever"? 

#mdadm -CR whatever -l0 -n2 /dev/nvme[01]n1

Please do not use --name= parameter.

I want to disable create_on_open and always use new_array in the future, without
fallback to create_on_open possibility. So I would like to have solution which
is not relying on it.

Got it, thanks!

Hmm, so maybe the existing MD device should be marked as "in the middle of
removal" somehow to gives mdadm possibility to detect that. If we are using
node as name "/dev/mdX" then we will need to throw error, but when node needs
to be determined by find_free_devnm() then it will simply skip this one and
gives next one. But it will require changes in kernel probably.

LGTM, I put small comment. But as I said before, probably it don't fix all
creation cases.

Thanks,
