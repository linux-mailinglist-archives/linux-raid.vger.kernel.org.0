And that's the whole point of TRIM. It tells mdadm absolutely nothing 
about the file system above APART FROM which part of the array is in use ...

But what we DO know, is that when the array is *created* THERE IS 
NOTHING STORED IN THE ARRAY.

TRIM is the mechanism used for one layer (any layer) to tell the layer 
below what part of the block device is in use. If raid can use TRIM to 
keep track of what blocks carry valid data, and what blocks contain 
garbage, then the raid itself can be much more efficient and pro-active 
at protecting that data.

You come over very much as believing that md-raid *should* *not* be 
improved. Is it really that perfect? Some of us are looking for 
opportunities to improve things, and actively supporting TRIM at the 
raid level is such an obvious advance ...

Whether it's worth the effort is a different question ... :-)

Can I ask a favour. STOP POURING COLD WATER ON OTHER PEOPLES' IDEAS. It 
doesn't achieve anything, and drives people away!

Cheers,
Wol
