Your proposal makes sense to me, yet still it requires significant rework
in generic_make_request(). I believe that generic_make_request() would 
have to return/store cookie for each subordinate bio. I'm wondering why 
cookie is needed for polling at all? From my understanding it looks 
like cookie info is used to find HW context which to poll on. Hybrid
polling uses it to find particular IO request and set its 'RQF_MQ_POLL_SLEPT'
flag. 

Now, if we assume that cookie is not passed to polling function, poll_fn
would need to find HW context to poll on in different way. Perhaps reference
to it could be stored in request_queue itself? Polling in stackable block
drivers would be much simpler -- they would call polling for underlying MQ
device, which in turn would poll on correct HW context.

Does this approach sound reasonable?
