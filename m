No, I do not prefer to return -1 and print error instead of returning EBUSY.
At first, I had the same idea as Martin, thinking that map_lock() would fail when
it is locked by someone else.Actually it is not fail but block. So now I just
print error and go ahead if map_lock() fails, like map_lock() elsewhere.

Is there any command to only write metadata?  Or change implementation of --add ?

When I test this patch, I find map_lock(）in --incremental is block but not fail.
So I think it will not fail when another array is assembled.

Here I add map_lock() before writing metadata and ulock it until finish. Do you
mean it should be before attempt_re_add()?
