https://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/fdisk-unable-to-create-partition-greater-2tb.html

"For example, you cannot create 3TB or 4TB partition size (RAID based) 
using the fdisk command. It will not allow you to create a partition 
that is greater than 2TB" makes me nervous

how to get a > 3 TB partition for /dev/md2

--------------------

and finally how would the command look for "Then with just two drives 
you change the raid to raid-1"?

the first two drives are ordered to start with 1 out of 4 machines ASAP 
given that the machine in front of me is running since 2011/06 365/24......
