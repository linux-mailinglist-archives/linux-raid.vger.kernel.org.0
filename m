We can't guarantee that. There is always a minimal chance to pass
wrong/invalid argument caused by bug somewhere else in mdadm logic.
I think that handling such case is reasonable from security point
of view but agree that it could be a dead check (if everything is
well implemented).

As before, we can't guarantee it, too. For now it seems to be well handled
but implementation may change and vulnerability might be missed during
review. Is safer to handle that some way.

Agree, but it could be changed.

Maybe It won't be useful for users but it may help developers to avoid
trivial mistakes. As you told, if everything is fine then check is dead.
In my opinion any error handling is better than nothing.

Anyway, I think that there is a lot of more dangerous lines.
