Again, we're in agreement here.  What you keep ignoring is the fact that
both of these take the same amount of time, provided that you are IO bound.

That is true, it does put less load on the machine giving it more time
to perform other tasks, but your original argument was that it is more
likely to fail during a rebuild.  I suppose if you take the two together
and assume the machine is busy servicing other tasks while doing the
rebuild, then both are probably going to slow down somewhat leading to
the rebuild taking a little longer, but I have a hard time believing
that it is going to be 2-3 times longer, or that it is really very
likely of having a second failure in that time.
