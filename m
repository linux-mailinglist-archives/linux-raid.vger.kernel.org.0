To my mind this is "premature optimisation".  I think it makes the core
harder to read.  If it makes the code easier to maintain then it might
be worth the cost.  I don't think it does.

Passing bools makes the calling code hard to read.  "What does that
"true" or "false" mean??".  Sometimes it really is best, but I think
passing the string "initrd" makes more sense to the reader than passing "true=
".

Passing enums is better than simple bools - and has the benefit of
spelling out the meaning of NULL.  These still feel a bit clumsy to me
so I would only use them when there is a clear benefit.

Certainly - thanks for catching that!

Jes - should I resent the whole series, or just this patch, or will you
edit before applying?

Thanks,
