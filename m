Mirroring is safe because, whatever happens to the mirror, you only need
one disk to recover. So if the raid falls apart your data is not in danger.

Do you need the entire space? Can you create a 900GB mirror on the 1TB?
You can always grow the mirror and the filesystem later.

They're no better! "SCT Error Recovery Control command not supported".
This is the red flag. This is the same problem as with the Barracudas.

And it applies to your 4TBs as well. I wouldn't worry too much - I'm
running a mirror on two 3TB Barracudas (I wouldn't have bought them if
I'd realised, but I was a raid newbie back then ...)
