Yeah, it does change, as you add LVM groups, you can still lead to
thrashing of the heads.  As you add layers, its harder and harder for
different filesystems to coordinate disk access.

But to me another big reason is KISS, Keep It Simple Stupid, so that
when things go wrong, it's not as hard to fix.

Well, as you add LVM volumes to a VG, I don't honestly know offhand if
the areas are pre-allocated, or not, I think they are pre-allocated,
but if you add/remove/resize LVs, you can start to get fragmentation,
which will hurt performance.

And note, I'm talking about harddisks here, with one read/write head.
SSDs are a different beast.

No, you still do not want the partitioned setup, becuase if you lose a
disk, you want to rebuild it entirely, all at once.  Personally, 5 x
8Tb disks setup in RAID10 with a hot spare sounds just fine to me.
You can survive a two disk failure if it doesn't hit both halves of
the mirror.  But the hot spare should help protect you.

One thing I really like to do is mix vendors in my array, just so I
dont' get caught by a bad batch.  And the RAID10 performance advantage
over RAID6 is big.  You'd only get 8Tb (only! :-) more space, but much
worse interactive response.

Physics sucks, don't it?  :-)

It's all about tradeoffs.

So that to me would tend to make me want to go with RAID10 to get the
best performance.  You could even go three disk RAID5 and a single
RAID10 to mix up the workloads, but then you lose the hot spare.

What I do is have a pair of mirrored SSDs setup to cache my RAID1
arrays, to give me more performance.  Not really sure if it's helping
or hurting really.  dm-cache isn't really great at reporting stats,
and I never bothered to test it hard.

My main box is an old AMD Phenom(tm) II X4 945 Processor, which is now
something like 10 years old.  It's fast enough for what I do.  I'm
more concerned with data loss than I am performance.

Sure, go for it.

Get a bigger case then.  :-)
