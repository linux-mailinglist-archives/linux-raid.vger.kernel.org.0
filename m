Looks like one of the first things I need to do when my raid testbed is 
up and running, is to set up a disk drive with dm-integrity --no-format, 
and see if I can dd successfully to it.

IFF that works, you'll then be able to just add it straight back in to 
the array, and running an integrity check will trigger a read error on 
anything that couldn't be recovered.

But there's no way I could recommend that at the moment, seeing as I 
have no idea whether or not it will actually work, even though I think 
it should.

Cheers,
Wol
