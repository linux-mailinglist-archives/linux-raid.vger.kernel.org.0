I think I remember back in the day that auto joining of raid1 arrays by
the kernel at boot time so that you could then mount the filesystem as
root, only worked if it was on partitions. That was a long time ago
though.

Good suggestion, but the drives indeed seem different, very slightly so.
Thankfully not enough to matter for my mdadm array it seems, so that's
good news

Thanks to all for the help
