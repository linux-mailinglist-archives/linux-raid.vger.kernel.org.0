Ah confirmation from what I read in a 2017 post *sigh*, naivete on my 
part thinking that with out partitions there was less to go wrong.

Thought this was to look for partition headers, I was assuming wrong 
again. I will try this.

Ah ha that explains that. I will kill what I can find.

I will try giving this ago, I was under the assumption as there is only 
one drive with a super block it would not, I will check the Wiki again 
to explore this and how to specify the drives.

Yes from now on it is partitions not raw drives haha.

I was just a machine reboot not even upgrades so bit lost on what caused 
the OS to scramble its self and prevent the OS from booting.
