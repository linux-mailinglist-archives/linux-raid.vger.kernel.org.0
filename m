Hmm, in the latest systemd source code, unit_kill_context() just simply =
ignores KILL_NONE (KillMode=3Dnone) like this,

4776         /* Kill the processes belonging to this unit, in =
preparation for shutting the unit down.
4777          * Returns > 0 if we killed something worth waiting for, 0 =
otherwise. */
4778
4779         if (c->kill_mode =3D=3D KILL_NONE)
4780                 return 0;

And no signal sent to target unit. Since there is no other location =
references KILL_NONE, it is not clear to me how KillMode=3Dnone may help =
more.

I have no too much understanding to systemd, I guess maybe (correct me =
if I am wrong) it was because the systemd used in RHEL is not the latest =
version?

Yes I agree. But for mdadm package in RHEL, I guess they don=E2=80=99t =
always use upstream mdadm, and just do backport for selected patches as =
other enterprise distributions do. If the latest mdadm and latest =
systemd work fine together, maybe the fast fix for RHEL is to just drop =
this patch from their backport, it is unnecessary to wait until the =
patch is reverted or fixed by upstream.

BTW, can I know the exact version of systemd from RHEL 8.7 and 9.1? On =
my openSUSE 15.4, the systemd version is 249.11, I will try to reproduce =
the operations as well, and try to find some clue if I am lucky.

Thanks.
