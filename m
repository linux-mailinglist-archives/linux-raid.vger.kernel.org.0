Apologies I feel like I am being extraordinarily thick!
I am trying to --assemble --force, I have tried listing the devices in 
the correct order after /dev/md0. To which I get

        sudo mdadm --assemble --force /dev/md0 /dev/sdc /dev/sdd
        /dev/sde /dev/sdf /dev/sdg /dev/sdh
        mdadm: /dev/sdd, is an invalid name for an md device - ignored.
        mdadm: /dev/sde, is an invalid name for an md device - ignored.
        mdadm: /dev/sdf, is an invalid name for an md device - ignored.
        mdadm: /dev/sdg, is an invalid name for an md device - ignored.
        mdadm: /dev/sdh is an invalid name for an md device - ignored.
        mdadm: No super block found on /dev/sdd (Expected magic
        a92b4efc, got 00000000)
        mdadm: no RAID superblock on /dev/sdd
        mdadm: /dev/sdd has no superblock - assembly aborted

I have tried listing the devices in the mdadm.configÂ  again with no luck.

        ARRAY /dev/md0 metadata=1.2 level=6 name=nas:0 devices=/dev/sdc,
        /dev/sdd, /dev/sde, /dev/sdf, /dev/sdg, /dev/sdh
        (NB:. both with spaces like above and with out space between the
        , ers)

To which I get.

        sudo mdadm --assemble --force /dev/md0
        mdadm: /dev/md0 assembled from 1 drive - not enough to start the
        array.

What am I missing?
