Yes.

Yes, this is exactly what I said implement a new file_operations(and
address_space ops), I wanted do this the easy way, just reuse the raw
block device ops, this way I just need to implement the submit_bio ops
for new hidden disk.

I can try with new fs type if we really think this solution is too
hacky, however, the code line will be much more. :(

Yes, for the page from bitmap, this set do the easy way just read and
ping all realted pages while loading the bitmap. For two reasons:

1) We don't need to allocate and read pages from IO path;(In the first
RFC version, I'm using a worker to do that).
2) In the first RFC version, I find and get page in the IO path, turns
out page reference is an *atomic*, and the overhead is not acceptable;

And the only action from IO path is that if bitmap page is dirty,
filemap_write_and_wait_range() is called from async worker, the same as
old bitmap, to flush bitmap dirty pages.

I'm not quite sure if I understand you correctly. Do you means don't use
pagecache for bitmap IO, and manually create BIOs like the old bitmap,
meanwhile invent a new solution for synchronism instead of the global
spin_lock from old bitmap?

Thanks,
Kuai
