I had 6TB X300 what worked fine about half year. Then it started to do 
clicking sound sometimes, until one evening I came home and and was 
clicking constantly. Stopped after reboot. But smart data was showing 
over 1000 g-shock errors, I think drive does detect every click as shock 
with that g-sensor, so I returned it to shop where I bough it.
So kinda bad experience of Toshiba drive to me. Reminded me of all 
issues I had with Hitachi 75GXP drives. I did RMA like 3 of them in row 
until I got enough and switched to WD.
I do not know if Toshiba 300 series drives are generally bad but by 
googling around, seems like quite many had same issues with that drive.
