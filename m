It does.

This is incorrect.

Either the Clang Thread Safety Analyser is broken, or you used it
incorrectly.

If mddev is NULL, the code does return (with -EBUSY).  All you've done
is change things so it returns from a different part of the code.  You
haven't changed the behaviour at all.

Certainly it should. mddev_lock() either returns 0 to indicate success
or -EINTR if it received a signal.
If it was interrupted by a signal, then rdev_attr_store() should return
=2DEINTR as well.

As Arnd tried to explain, the only possible problem here is that the C
compiler is allowed to assume that rdev->mddev never changes value, so
in
   rv =3D mddev ? mddev_lock(mddev) : =3DEBUSY

it could load rdev->mddev, test if it is NULL, then load it again and
pass that value to mddev_lock() - the new value might be NULL which
would cause problems.

This could be fixed by changing

	struct mddev *mddev =3D rdev->mddev;
to
	struct mddev *mddev =3D READ_ONCE(rdev->mddev);

That is the only change that might be useful here.
