A perfect example of this (although I can't see myself growing the 
partitions in this case) is a mirrored /boot.

Superblock 1.0 means that anything can read the partition without 
needing to know about raid. One less thing to go wrong. And I can raid-1 
an EFI partition - I just need to make sure I only modify it from within 
linux so it gets mirrored across both drives. I would want that as 
protection against my primary drive failing - then my EFI partition is 
mirrored letting me boot from the secondary.

Cheers,
Wol
