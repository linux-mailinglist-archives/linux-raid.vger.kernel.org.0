There is a code:
	if (create && !regular && !preferred) {
		static char buf[30]; <- this variable will survive retry.
		snprintf(buf, sizeof(buf), "%d:%d", major, minor);
		regular = buf;
	}
but seems that it is not a case for this scenario. I suspected that
this was used because when gathering container name:

		container = map_dev_preferred(major(devid), minor(devid),
					      1, c->prefer);

'create' is explicitly set to 1. That is why I expect to have 'container'
declared in static area. Make sense?

Sure, we are in rc2, so bigger changes should be merged after release.
It need to wait for now. Seems to be good future improvement.

Agree. So, will you take care about all improvements later (after release)?
