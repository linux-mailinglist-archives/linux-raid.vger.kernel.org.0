Thanks Roger.

My apologies for not replying earlier.  By the time I read this I already=
=20
had a reshape underway to reduce the size of the array back to the origin=
al=20
30 disks.  So far it seems to be progressing OK although the ETA is aroun=
d=20
10 days which is why I didn=E2=80=99t respond sooner =E2=80=93 I=E2=80=99=
ve been bury dealing with=20
the fallout from this.

Do I understand that you would recommend upgrading our installation of Li=
nux=20
once the repair is complete or are advising downloading and compiling a n=
ew=20
kernel as part of the repair?  Or are you suggesting that it was the fact=
=20
that we=E2=80=99re on such an old version of CentOS that caused this mess=
?  I ask=20
because once this is repaired (assuming it does complete successfully), I=
=20
would like to extend the array to the full 45 drives of which this server=
 is=20
capable

Thanks,
Bob

Subject: Re: Failed adadm RAID array after aborted Grown operation

The short term easiest way for a new kernel might be this.

Download a Fedora 35 livecd and boot from it.  It will allow you to turn =
on=20
the raid and/or reshape the raid and/or abort the reshape using the fedor=
a=20
35 kernel and mdadm tools.    Though all of this will need to be done=20
manually from either the gui and/or command line, so it will be somewhat =
of=20
a pain.

The other choice is to download/compile/install a current http://kernel.o=
rg=20
kernel.  This takes some time (you have to install compiler/header rpms),=
=20
and follow this=20
(https://docs.rockylinux.org/guides/custom-linux-kernel/)--rockylinux so =
a=20
redhat clone list of instructions.  How long it takes will depend on the=20
number of cpus your machine has and the value after the -j<cpustouse>.=20
The biggest issue with this will likely be dealing with compile errors fo=
r=20
missing dependencies you get for this or that tool and/or devel package=20
being missing.   And then you would still need to download the newest mda=
dm=20
and compile and install it.   These steps will take longer, but doing thi=
s=20
will get your system on a new kernel and new tools, and typically once yo=
u=20
know how to do this, this process of compiling/installing a kernel has fo=
r=20
the most part not changed in a long time.  And I have been doing this on =
and=20
off for 20+ years and newer kernel on older userspace is widely used by a=
=20
lot of the kernel developers so is generally well testing and in my=20
experience just works to get you on a new kernel with minimal trouble.

I don't know :-( This is getting a bit out of my depth. But I'm
SERIOUSLY concerned you're still futzing about with CentOS 7!!!

Why didn't you download CentOS 8.5? Why didn't you download RHEL 8.5, or
the latest Fedora? Why didn't you download SUSE SLES 15?

Any and all CentOS 7 will come with either an out-of-date mdadm, or a
Frankenkernel. NEITHER are a good idea.

Go back to the links I gave you, download and run lsdrv, and post the
output here. Hopefully somebody will tell you the next steps. I will do
my best.
