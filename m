mdadm/raid will take care of /boot/efi provided both (a) it's set up 
correctly, and (b) nothing outside of linux modifies it.

You can always run a raid integrity check (can't remember what it's 
called / the syntax) which will confirm they are identical.

But if something *has* messed with the mirror outside of linux, the only 
way you can find out what happened is to mount the underlying partitions 
(for heavens sake do that read only !!!) and compare them.

A bit of suggested ?light reading for you - get your head round the 
difference between superblocks 1.0 and 1.2, understand how raid can 
mirror a fat partition and why that only works with 1.0, and then 
understand how you can mount the underlying efi fat partitions 
separately from the raided partition.

Read the raid wiki https://raid.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Linux_Raid and 
try to get to grips with what is actually going on ...

Cheers,
Wol
