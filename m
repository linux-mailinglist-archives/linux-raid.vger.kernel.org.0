Raid 0? Not that good an idea ... bear in mind in this case 
probabilities add up - you've just TREBLED your chances of losing your

uname -a ?
mdadm --version ?

This sounds similar to a problem we've regularly seen with raid-5. And 
it's noticeable with older Ubuntus.

Ahhhhh ... you MAY be able to RMA them. What are they? If they're WD 
Reds I'd RMA them as a matter of course as "unfit for purpose". If 
they're BarraCudas, well, tough luck but you might get away with it.

DON'T use a backup file unless it tells you it needs it. Usually it 
doesn't, now, if you're adding space I believe it dumps the backup in 
the new space that will become available.

So we have a four-drive raid 5. Not bad. Does that include one of the 
SMR drives?!?

Okay. What are those drives? I'm *guessing* your original three drives 
were WD Reds. What is the type number? If they're Reds this ends in EFAX 
or EFRX, if I remember correctly. I think EFAX are good and EFRX are 
bad. It could be the other way round ...

I'll let others comment.

Don't mess with it yet.

What I personally would do is - if the old drives are okay and you can 
RMA the two new ones - RMA one of them and swap it for a BarraCuda 12TB. 
I think a 4TB Red is about £100 and a 12TB BarraCuda is about £200. Yes 
I know BarraCudas are SMR, but this is a backup drive, so it doesn't 
really matter. RMA the other and swap it for a 4TB IronWolf.

Timing here is the problem - one drive you want to RMA is currently in 
the array, and you don't want to return it until you've got both new 
drives. Get the BarraCuda and back up the array first. Then ADD the 
IronWolf using "mdadm --replace /dev/smr --with /dev/ironwolf". The 
other possibility is, IFF it was a shop and you can go in person, they 
might be able to copy the data from one drive to the other - "dd -if 
/dev/Red -of /dev/IronWolf". That will at least keep your data safe AND 
REDUNDANT.

(Oh, and if you're returning £200 of drives and swapping it for £300, 
they might decide to be kind ... :-)

That should stream all the data off the SMR drive on to the IronWolf and 
you should end up with a properly working array ... (although if the 
shop copied it, this will be irrelevant.)

(I'd put LVM on the BarraCuda, so you can then use an "inplace rsync" to 
take incremental backups - remember RAID IS NOT A BACKUP.)

NB - if you found the wiki, why didn't you follow its advice ...
https://raid.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Linux_Raid#When_Things_Go_Wrogn
There's a reason we ask for all that information ;-) which is why I've 
asked you for a lot of the information you should have supplied already 
:-) Yes it's a lot we ask for, but I'm guessing a lot here, and guesses 
aren't a good idea for your data ...

Cheers,
Wol
