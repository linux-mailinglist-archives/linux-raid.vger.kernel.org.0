And if you've got spinning rust, that's unlikely to be true. I can't 
speak for SATA, but on PATA I've personally experienced the exact 
opposite. Doubling the load on the interface absolutely DEMOLISHED 
throughput, turning what should have been a five-minute job into a 
several-hours job.

And if you've got many drives in your stripe, who's to say that won't 
overwhelm the i/o bandwidth. Your reads could be 50% or less of full 
speed, because there isn't the back end capacity to pass them on.

Cheers,
Wol
