Hi all

It seems the badblocks list was added around 10 years ago[1]. The reason wa=
s to keep a track on sectors not readable, which may have made sensee 20 ye=
ars earlier, but not even in 2010. The first IDE drives came out in the end=
 of the 1980s and were named thus of their 'Integrated Drive Electronics' w=
hich was a new thing at the time. Opposed to earlier MFM drives and such, t=
hese were "smart" and could handle errors a bit better, even reallocate bad=
 sectors to somewhere else when needed. A lot happened beween 1987 and 2010=
, but for some reason, this feature slipped through anyway, perhaps becauas=
e Linus was drunk, I don't know. As far as I can understand, this feature w=
orks a bit like this

 - If a bad (that is, unreadable) block is found, it is flagged as bad, not=
 to be used ever again, in the md member's superblock
 - If a new disk is added to the array, the block number of the initial bad=
 block is flagged on the new drive, since the whole stripe is rendered usel=
ess (erm, didn't we have redundency here?)
 - If replacing the original drive with a new drive, md happily replaces al=
l the data to the new drive and updates the superblock with the same badblo=
ck list.

So no attempt is ever done to check or repair that sector. Disks reallocate=
 sectors if they are bad and it's not necessarily a big issue unless there'=
s a lot of such errors. We just say 'this sector or block said *ouch* and i=
s thus dead, and so will his siblings be for ever and ever'. There's a nice=
 article about it here[2].

In practice, if you have data in stripes with badblocks, they may be lost f=
orever and for no reason at all, since drives tend to fix their problems if=
 you issue a write to that sector. ZFS does this nicely - when it finds a b=
ad read, it reconstructs from parity or mirror and writes it again. If it e=
ncounters a write error, it tries over. Eventually the drive may fail, but =
hell, that's why we have redundancy.

As far as I can see, the only solution to remove the badblocks list, is "md=
adm ... --assemble --update=3Dno-bbl", from [2], and have md return garbage=
 for those lost sectors, which is fine, since fsck/xfs_repair should fix wh=
at's fixable (and still won't be readable anyway). An alternate version wri=
tten by a friend of mine (H=C3=A5kon on cc) is present on [3] to remove the=
 list from an offlined array.

As far as I can understand, this list doesn't have any reason to exist, exc=
ept to annoy sysadmins.

So please remove this useless thing or at least don't enable it by default
