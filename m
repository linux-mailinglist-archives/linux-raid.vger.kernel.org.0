Yes, thanks for the pointer. I agree nobody else was crashing due to this
but it will be causing interesting inconsistencies in accounting and
throttling in all the IO controllers - e.g. usually both original
and cloned bio will get accounted to md0 device and loop0 device settings
will be completely ignored. From my experience these things do not
get really tested too much until some customer tries to use them :). So I
think we have to effectively revert your above change. I'll send a patch.
