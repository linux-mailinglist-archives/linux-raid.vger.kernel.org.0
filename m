Hi Martin

It looks like I understood you wrongly. I thought you wanted to remove
mdcheck_continue.service totally in future. So I tried to discuss this
problem with you. For patch 3/4, I'd like you to describe the race in
detail. Because commit 8aa4ea9 ("systemd: start mdcheck_continue.timer
before mdcheck_start.timer") already fixes this problem. Why does the
race come up again?

I have a question about the mdcheck_start.timer change. Now by
default, the start timer is triggered at 0:45:00 and the continue
timer is triggered at 1:00. So the check can't continue if the check
hasn't finished in one month which you fixed in 8aa4ea9?

Sorry for bringing this trouble to you.

Xiao
