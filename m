Hi Wol,

I did read the links you sent, actually I'd already trawled through them=20
prior to subscribing to the mailing list. They're how I learned about the=
=20
mailing list.

It seems that the conventional version of CentOS 8.5 is no longer availab=
le,=20
there's just the CentOS 8 Streams version and I wasn't sure how it would =
go=20
with the old style of CentOS. To be honest it didn't occur to me to go wi=
th=20
another flavour of Linux, I just figured that I'd use CentOS to repair=20
CentOS.

Anyway, I did try using "mdadm /dev/md2 -r detached" and "mdadm /dev/md2 =
-r=20
failed" to remove the removed disk to no avail.  I ended up using=20
"mdadm --grow /dev/md125 --array-size=20
218789036032 --backup-file=3D/mnt/sysimage/grow_md125_size_grow.bak --ver=
bose"=20
followed by "mdadm --grow=20
/dev/md125 --raid-devices=3D30 --backup-file=3D/mnt/sysimage/grow_md125_g=
row_disks.bak=20
 --verbose" and it seems to be working in that it is reshaping the array=20
although it is apparently going to take around 16,000 minutes (would that=
 be=20
because we've about 200TB of data?).

My concern now is whether or not I'll still have the mount issue once it=20
finally completes the reshape.  If it does mount OK, does that mean I'm g=
ood=20
to reboot it?

With regards to your comment about downloading lsdrv, I'll try and do tha=
t=20
although I'm having trouble configuring my DNS servers in the running res=
cue=20
disk OS. I could run lsblk but, from what I see of lsdrv, lsblk doesn't h=
ave=20
the detail that lsdrv has. I'll keep working on that and let you know wha=
t I=20
get - it looks like I have to edit it to use the older version of Python=20
that this installation has.

Cheers,
Bob

I don't know :-( This is getting a bit out of my depth. But I'm SERIOUSLY=
=20
concerned you're still futzing about with CentOS 7!!!

Why didn't you download CentOS 8.5? Why didn't you download RHEL 8.5, or =
the=20
latest Fedora? Why didn't you download SUSE SLES 15?

Any and all CentOS 7 will come with either an out-of-date mdadm, or a=20
Frankenkernel. NEITHER are a good idea.

Go back to the links I gave you, download and run lsdrv, and post the out=
put=20
here. Hopefully somebody will tell you the next steps. I will do my best.
