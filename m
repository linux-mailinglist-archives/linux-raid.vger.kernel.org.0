Just try it, as I said before with LVM it is easy to remove if it doesn't work
out. You can always go to the manual copying method or whatnot, but first why
not check if the automatic caching solution might be "good enough" for your
needs.

Yes it usually tries to avoid caching long sequential reads or writes, but
there's also quite a bit of other load on the FS, i.e. metadata. I found that
browsing directories and especially mounting the filesystem had a great
benefit from caching.

You are correct that it will try to increase performance via writeback
caching, however with LVM that needs to be enabled explicitly:
https://www.systutorials.com/docs/linux/man/7-lvmcache/#lbAK
And of course a failure of that cache SSD will mean losing some data, even if
the main array is RAID. Perhaps should consider a RAID of SSDs for cache in
that case then.
