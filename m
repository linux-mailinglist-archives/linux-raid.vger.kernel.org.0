I did say "so long as you don't do anything exotic". Raids 0 and 1 are 
apparently pretty rock solid, so long as you've actually GOT raid 1, see 
my comment about that!

The snapshot issue is supposedly fixed, but that's part of the disk full 
issue. I agree - it's crazy you can't drop a snapshot to recover disk 
space if the disk fills up - hell that should have been one of the FIRST 
things to be made rock solid, not one of the last!

But I do get the impression that btrfs is finally, provided you avoid 
all the EXPERIMENTAL (which is most of them :-) features is a decent 
file system.

Unfortunately, it seems to be typical in the linux world, you have a 
feature which is broken (alsa, ext4, sysVinit, zfs licence etc), and 
when somebody tries to design and write a decent replacement, the 
distros push it out into the "stable distro" world before it's ready. 
And so decent systems get a bad rep while in beta (or even alpha) 
through no fault of the person/team writing them. Mind you, most of 
btrfs is still alpha :-)

And no. The only place I use it is where it's the SUSE default. Not even 
there, maybe, I think it uses it for /home and I share that between 
distros ...

Cheers,
Wol
