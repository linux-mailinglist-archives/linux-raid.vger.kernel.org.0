I have made some changes and applied the set to md-next. However,
I think we don't yet have enough test coverage. Please continue testing
the code and send fixes on top of it. Based on the test results, we will
see whether we can ship it in the next merge window.

Note, md-next branch doesn't have [1], so we need to cherry-pick it
for testing.

Thanks,
Song
