That doesn't cover it. Not all of the virtual partitions necessarily
need to have their own dm-crypt, so they should be encrypted by the
underlying dm-crypt.

So the dm-crypt doesn't just need to cover the partition table, but
also arbitrary ranges within the whole partition

I don't quite understand the difference between a loopback file, and a
block driver that uses space from a filesystem space pool. Isn't that
what a loopback file is?

I'd expect that the lower encryption layer has an opt-in flag to turn
on and off passthrough functionality. I think I neglected to mention
that before; it was discussed in other threads and I just kinda
assumed that it would be there.

So, with that in mind: the loadable code could set the flag, but the
underlying dm-inlinecrypt would need to opt into the weaker security
too. If the system administrator has opted the lower layer into
passthrough, then they've considered the risks of what could happen if
an upper layer sets the flag and decided that it's OK. If the
administrator didn't opt in, then the flag has no effect. Does that
sound more acceptable?

I can't get rid of the loopback devices. They're an essential part of
this. I should be able to take the encrypted loopback file, send it to
a different machine, and have it keep working the same as it always
has.

Without the loopback device, I'm stuck with fscrypt. Which isn't
supported by all filesystems, and encrypts much less data than we
require.
