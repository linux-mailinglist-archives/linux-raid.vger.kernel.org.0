Hi Hannes,

Will be great if you can handle this. Beside library part you did huge code
rearrangement and divides one big mdadm.h header into separate ones which is
also great improvement. mdadm.h is still growing.

It is hard to do this separately, one by one due to cross references between
files.

Thanks,
Mariusz
