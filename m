If you dare to try, you can use
"raid6check" which should be
together with "mdadm" (at least
in source form).

If I recall correctly, this could
check a given range (whole array will
take forever) and report, if possible,
*which* drive is having the mismatch.

It is also possible to use it to
repair the mismatch, if caused by a
single drive problem.

Of course, standard disclaimer is that
nothing is guarantee to work as advertised.
Use at your own risk...
