Because rebuilding sda is a lot of work. The sensible option would have 
been to leave sdb and sdc active, and left sda as spare.

I'd just leave it as a 3-disk raid. But no, if you do want to set it 
back to a 2-disk raid don't do a "faulty and re-add" - that'll just make 
re-sync it again. Somehow you've got active devices set to 3, so just 
set that back to two. If you look on the wiki it covers the scenario of 
converting a three-disk raid to two.

The only thing I will add about a 3-disk raid is that if you want to 
change it to anything else, you'll have to revert to 2 first, but do 
that when you want to change things, leave it at 3 for the moment.
