Why would the distributions need to know all about every other OS, and 
what do you mean by "all" ?

I blame UEFI firmware vendors first, for improperly implementing the 
UEFI boot specification. Then I blame operating system vendors for not 
natively handling the case of multiple redundant EFI partitions.

Back on topic, if you mean Windows+Linux dual boot, it seems unlikely to 
me that this can be achieved with Linux software RAID, because Windows 
does not support it and Windows software RAID usually works on whole drives.
If you mean Linux dual-boot, you do not need multiple boot loaders, one 
single boot loader can boot all Linux systems.

I suspect we are misunderstanding each other about the meaning of "sync 
EFI partitions" and it may be my fault for not being clear enough. 
First, I do not mean to sync the whole EFI partition contents but only 
the part which belongs to the running operating system. This way, 
neither knowledge or cooperation of other operating systems is required.
Second, I do not mean "sync" in the sense of doing what rsync does but 
in the sense of writing the same stuff in all EFI partitions in the 
first place, instead of writing stuff in one "main" EFI partition only 
and sync'ing other EFI partitions at a later time.
