Phil> +1 for netconsole.  Also enable the SysRq key for thread dumps.
Phil> So you have the dump before you reset.

Can you explain more about your hardware?  Is it new?  Have you made
any changes recently?  Is there any over clocking?  As for changes,
I'm talking both hardware and software.  What daemons are you running?
Anything that changed is a good thing to take a long hard look at.  

If you have another system, remote syslog might also be something to
add into the mix.  I also really like serial consoles, so you can
capture all the output onto another system easily.

It might also be useful to try going back to an older kernel, but I
haven't a clue how hard that is with gentoo.  Does the distro still
expect you to compile everything and bootstrap yourself these days?

Good luck!
John
