I think it's unreliable. GRUB can write to the ESP when grubenv is on
it. And sd-boot likewise can write to the ESP as part of
https://systemd.io/AUTOMATIC_BOOT_ASSESSMENT/

And the firmware itself can write to the ESP for any reason but most
commonly when cleaning up after firmware updates. Any of these events
would write to just one of the members, and involve file system
writes. So now what happens when they're assembled by mdadm as a raid,
and the two member devices have the same event count, and yet now
completely different file system states? I think it's a train wreck.
