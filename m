I use debugfs to do this. Knowing each fs block range (lo hi) calculated from the raid mismatch notice:

I first identify the relevant blocks in each reported range with
	debugfs -R "testb $lo $((hi-lo))" $device
then locate the associated inodes with
	debugfs -R "icheck $list" $device
and finally discover files in these locations with
	debugfs -R "ncheck $inode" $device

Some of the above debugfs requests can take a very long time to perform. I actually have a script that
does everything and can be left to run for a day (or longer) but it is very locally specific for my setup.
