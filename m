Basically, the reason to use raid10 over raid6 is to increase performance. =
This is particularly important regarding rebuild times. If you have a huge =
raid-6 array with large drives, it'll take a long time to rebuild it after =
a disk fails. With raid10, this is far lower, since you don't need to rewri=
te and compute so much. Personally, I'd choose raid6 over raid10 in most se=
tups unless I need I lot of IOPS, where RAID6 isn't that good. RAID5 is als=
o ok, if you don't have too much drives, but if you get a double disk failu=
re, well, you're fucked.

PS: Always make sure to have a good backup. RAID isn't backup, it's just re=
dundancy and won't help you if your house burns down or a filesystem messes=
 up after a PSU problem or similar.=20
