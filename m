The behavior here in the post is rather debian specific. The initrd from 
debian refuses to continue  if it cannot get all partitions mentioned in 
the fstab. On top i suspect an error in the initrd that the OP is using 
which leads to the raid not coming up with a single disk.

The problems from the OP have imho not much to do with raid, and a lot 
with debian specific issues/perhaps a mistake from the OP

Cheers
