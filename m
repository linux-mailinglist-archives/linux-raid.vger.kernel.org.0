Not wise - as you've found out it was trashing your redundancy ...

That feels good, but I'm not sure how to proceed from here.

The first page talks about overlays. THEY WILL PROTECT YOUR DATA.

Make sure every disk is overlayed, then try assembling the overlays with 
your assume-clean. You won't need read-only but do it if you like it 
then do.

If you can then mount and run a fsck or whatever it is over the file 
system and it says everything is clean, then you can redo it without the 
overlays and recover the array properly. If it's messed up, just tear 
down the overlays and you're back where you started.

If it doesn't work, come back and tell us what happened (if it does 
work, please let us know :-)

Cheers,
Wol
