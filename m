Yes, but IV is in reality not a cryptographic algorithm, it is kind-of a configuration
"option" of sector encryption mode here.

We had all of disk-IV inside dmcrypt before - but once it is partially moved into crypto API
(ESSIV, EBOIV for now), it becomes much more complicated for user to select what he needs.

I think we have no way to check that IV is available from userspace - it
will report the same error as if block cipher is not available, not helping user much
with the error.

But then I also think we should add abstract dm-crypt options here (Legacy TrueCrypt modes,
Bitlocker modes) that will select these crypto API configuration switches.
Otherwise it will be only a complicated matrix of crypto API options...
