Unfortunately, about the only constructive advice I can give you is 
"live and learn". I made a similar massive cock-up at the start of my 
career, and I've always been excessively cautious about disks and data 
ever since.

What your employer needs to take away from this - and no disrespect to 
yourself - is that if they run a system that was probably supported for 
about five years, then has been running on duck tape and baling wire for 
a further ten years, DON'T give it to someone with pretty much NO 
sysadmin or computer ops experience to carry out a potentially 
disastrous operation like messing about with a raid array!

This is NOT a simple setup, and it seems clear to me that you have 
little familiarity with the basic concepts. Unfortunately, your employer 
was playing Russian Roulette, and the gun went off.

On a *personal* level, and especially if your employer wants you to 
continue looking after their systems, they need to give you an (old?) 
box with a bunch of disk drives. Go back to the raid website and look at 
the article about building a new system. Take that system they've given 
you, and use that article as a guide to build it from scratch. It's 
actually about the computer being used right now to type this message.

I use(d) gentoo as my distro. It's a great distro, but for a newbie I 
think it takes "throw them in at the deep end" to extremes. Go find 
Slackware and start with that. It's not a "hold their hands and do 
everything for them" distro, but nor is it a "here's the instructions, 
if they don't work for you then you're on your own" distro. Once you've 
got to grips with Slack, have a go at gentoo. And once you've managed to 
get gentoo working, you should have a pretty decent grasp of what's 
going "under the bonnet". CentOS/RedHat/SLES should be a breeze after that.

Cheers,
Wol
