Sorry about that. Apparently that happens when I send from mobile, and
I couldn't find a setting to change it. I'll stick to replying from
the computer from now on. I've re-attached the message below, so that
it gets wrapped properly

As mentioned earlier in the thread: I don't have a usecase
specifically for this and it was an example of a situation where
passthrough is necessary and no filesystem is involved at all. Though,
as I also pointed out, a usecase where you're putting encrypted
virtual partitions on an encrypted LVM setup isn't all that absurd.

In my real-world case, I'm putting encrypted loop devices on top of a
filesystem that holds its own sensitive data. Each loop device has
dm-crypt inside and uses a unique key, but the filesystem needs to be
encrypted too (because, again, it has its own sensitive data outside
of the loop devices). The loop devices cannot be put onto their own
separate partition because there's no good way to know ahead of time
how much space either of the partitions would need: sometimes the loop
devices need to take up loads of space on the partition, and other
times the non-loop-device data needs to take up that space. And to top
it all off, the distribution of allocated space needs to change
dynamically.

The current Linux kernel does not support this use-case without double
encryption. The loop devices are encrypted once with their own
dm-crypt instance. Then that same data is encrypted a second time over
by the partition.

Actually this scenario is simplified. We actually want to use fscrypt
inside of the loopback file too. So actually, without the passthrough
mechanism some data would be encrypted three distinct times.

Ultimately, I'm unsure what the concern is here.

It's a glaringly loud opt-in marker that encryption was already
performed or is otherwise intentionally unnecessary. The flag existing
isn't what punches through the security model. It's the use of the
flag that does. I can't imagine anything setting the flag by accident.
So what are you actually concerned about? How are you expecting this
flag to actually be misused?

As for third party modules that might punch holes, so what? 3rd party
modules aren't the kernel's responsibility or problem

Please see my follow up. This is actually not feasible because it
doesn't work. Sometimes, fscrypt will just ask to move encrypted
blocks around without providing an encryption context; the data
doesn't need to be decrypted to be reshuffled on disk. This flag-less
approach I describe would actually just break: it it would
unintentionally encrypt that data during shuffling.

In my loopback file scenario, what would be the one layer that could
handle the encryption?

- the loopback files are just regular files that happen to have
encrypted data inside of them. Doing it a different way changes the
semantics: with a loopback file, I'm able to move it into a basic FAT
filesystem and back without losing the encryption on the data

- the filesystem is completely unaware of any encryption. The loopback
files are just files with random content inside. The filesystem itself
is encrypted from below by the block layer. So, there's nothing for it
to do.

- the underlying instance of dm-crypt is encrypting a single opaque
blob of data, and so without explicit communication from above it
cannot possibly know how to handle this.

Thus, I don't see a single layer that can handle this. The only
solution is for upper layers to communicate downward.

Best,
Adrian
