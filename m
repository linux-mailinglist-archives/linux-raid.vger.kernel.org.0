Yes.

Creating a raid array on an entire device means

"mdadm --create --devices sda sdb"

partioning a raid array means

"fdisk /dev/md127"

Remember linux doesn't care what a block device is, it's a block device.
So you can put a raid array directly on top of physical disks, and you
can put a GPT on top of a raid array.

Neither are recommended.

Wol
