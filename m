Yeah, I'm pretty sure the current behavior is suboptimal just because
it was easier for the implementation. And ... surprisingly ... this
feature request is my clumsy try to convince someone amazing and clever
to change that, because ... we love Linux and wanna se it rock! Right? :D=

I'm aware of the risks ... but, losing a file or two is still much better=

than losing the whole array just because of the low sync speed when you
need to operate the array in a degraded mode for 3 days instead of 1 day.=

Making it faster seems to me quite important / reasonable.


>How often are you replacing/rebuilding the disks and why?

Few times a year, different reasons. Usually requests for higher capacity=

where I need to replace all drives one by one and then grow the array.
Sometimes reallocated sectors appear in the SMART output and I never
let such drives in the array considering them unreliable. The --replace
feature is nice, but often there's no room for one more drive in the
chasis and going that way requires an external USB3 rack and a bit of
magic if the operation cannot be done offline.

So, I still hope someone will find enough courage one day to implement
the new optional sync strategy :)

BR, J.
