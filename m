1a: sure.  1b:  I can think of many things that aren't *necessary* but 
are certainly worthwhile.  I can even throw a few out there, like 
personal hygiene, healthy diets, exercise.  In this context, I would 
list drive smart monitoring, weekly scrubs, and sysadmins with a clue.

Who says it has no purpose.  Its purpose is to segment a device into 
regions with associated metadata.

Hmm.  A sector offset and limit check, buried deep in the kernel's 
common code.  I dare you to measure the incremental impact.

You assert "no gain", but you provide no support for your assertion.

You assert "no positive result whatsoever".  Sounds like #4.  With 
similar lack of support.  Fluffing up your list, much?

No relevance?  Metadata can be rather useful when operating systems 
encounter what looks like an empty disk.  Metadata that says "not 
empty!"  Especially valuable when metadata is *recognized* by all 
operating systems.  You know, like, a *standard*.  While MDraid places 
metadata on the devices it uses, only Linux *recognizes* it.

Just more fluff.

Microsoft and a number of NAS products are known to corrupt drives with 
no partition table.  I vaguely recall hardware raid doing it, too. 
That's a damn good reason to add a tiny (measurable?) amount of overhead.

And dude, making a single partition on a disk can be /scripted/.  Might 
want to learn about that, if the pain of the driving fdisk/gdisk 
occasionally is too much for your delicate fingers.
