The write hole happen, generically,
when data is written to a stripe
and, whatever the reason, the write
is not completed to all devices.
So, some chunks contain new data,
some others old data.

A cause could be a sudded power loss.

The parity will be likely wrong,
and it can be fixed, but this will
not help to get proper data (all
new or all old, but not mixed).

Well, since nobody knows what is
written, it could be as well some
metadata will be in inconsistent
state, partially written.

Then, depending on the FS, this might
or might not be a problem.

I'm not 100% sure the journal will be a
solution anyway.
I mean, the device holding the journal
should be redundant too, so the journal
itself might be subject to write hole.

I might be completely wrong, here, anyway.
