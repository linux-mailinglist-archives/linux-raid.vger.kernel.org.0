Hi roy.

Thank you for your time.

Now, I'm doing a photorec on /dev/sda and /dev/sdd and I get better
results on (some) of the data recovered if I do it on top of /dev/md0.
I don't care anymore about recovering the filesystem, I just want to
maximize the quality of data recovered with photorec.

Best regards,
Jorge
