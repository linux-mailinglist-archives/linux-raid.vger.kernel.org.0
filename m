Once things start going wrong, they go pear-shaped very fast.

https://raid.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Timeout_Mismatch

tl;dr

Raid/Enterprise drives have something called SCT/ERC. If there's a 
problem, the drive will abort the read/write, and return an error.

Consumer drives don't have this. If there's a problem, they can 
typically take two minutes to respond. No matter whether the problem is 
transient or real, that's a real bummer for whatever wants the data. The 
kernel typically gives up waiting after 30secs, tries to talk to the 
drive again, and on getting no response whatsoever assumes the disk has 
failed. As far as raid is concerned, a faulty, non-responsive disk is 
BAD NEWS.

It gets worse. SMR drives can - in the NORMAL course of events, take 
about ten minutes to respond!

So basically, Enterprise drives typically take about 7 seconds to sort 
out a problem. Consumer drives - the old CMR type - typically take about 
2 minutes. New SMR drives can take 10s of minutes. And transient 
problems aren't that uncommon. Worse, once things start going wrong, it 
can explode very fast.

Cheers,
Wol
