Dare I suggest you read the raid wiki site?

In particular
https://raid.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Setting_up_a_(new)_system
https://raid.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Converting_an_existing_system

Also a very good read ...
https://raid.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/System2020
Which is the system I'm typing this on.

These pages don't all jibe with what I remember writing, but read them 
carefully, make sure you understand what is going on, and more 
importantly WHY, and you should be good to go.

And when you're wondering how to go from the 4-drive raid-10 to the 
2-drive raid-1, you should be able to just fail/remove the two small 
drives and everything will migrate to your two new big drives, and then 
it's just whatever the command is to convert between raid levels. The 
drives will already be in a raid-1 layout, so converting from 10 to 1 
will just be a change of metadata.

Cheers,
Wol
