So it just waits until that UUID appears ...

Dunno whether my system is configured with UUID or device name, but root 
is on an array, and there's no mdadm.conf. Works fine ...

That's why the suggestion is "use eg /dev/md/root".

I'm with the OP. You don't need an mdadm.conf, so don't bother with it.

Cheers,
