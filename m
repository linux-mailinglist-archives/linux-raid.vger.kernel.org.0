by wasting even more space

the point of mirroring is that there are two phyiscal drives with each 
stripe

you can even have 20 partitions on the disks and make a big RAID10 out 
of them - not that it makes sense but you can

the point of such setups is typically temporary: at the moment only two 
disks are here but i want a RAID10 at the end of the day

for such setups often you even start with a degraded RAID and later add 
drives
