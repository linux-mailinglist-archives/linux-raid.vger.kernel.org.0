My question revolves around when there are "rc" kernels, is their extra debugging tracing or any other built in "inefficiencies" in release candidates that get configured out of the released kernels?

Bear in mind the whole point of rc is to shake out minor glitches. Linus 
takes a whole bunch of "improvements" into rc1, and they get shaken down 
over the following rcs. So I guess someone put in a load of improvements 
that got selected for rc1.

They may not initially have worked as well as planned, and other people 
would have spotted problems. I get the impression there's a lot of room 
for improvement, and I think Christoph Hellwig has been working hard on 
this. So there's a good chance some of his stuff got into rc1, and he's 
kept tweaking it through the next rcs. And you've benefited!

Cheers,
Wol
