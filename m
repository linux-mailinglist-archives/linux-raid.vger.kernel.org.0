What did you change in the new v2? Removing "extern" in the header?
For small changes like this, I can just update it while applying the patches.
If we do need resend (for bigger changes), it's better to call it v3.

I was testing the first v2 in the past hour or so, it looks good in the test.
I will take a closer look tomorrow. On the other hand, we are getting close
to the 5.12 merge window, so it is a little too late for bigger
changes like this.
Therefore, I would prefer to wait until 5.13. If you need it in 5.12 for some
reason, please let me know.

Thanks,
Song
