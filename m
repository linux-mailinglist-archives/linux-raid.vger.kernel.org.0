Did you test kernel with my patchset applied?

I've added chapter 4 because I'm aware of behavior change.
Now for r0, nothing happens when we are trying to write failure to
md/<disk>/state.
 
After the change, drive is not remove too, but MD_BROKEN is set and
any new write will be rejected. The drive will be still visible
in array (I didn't change that). Should I add it to description?

Thanks,
Mariusz
