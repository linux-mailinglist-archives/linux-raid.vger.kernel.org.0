Thank you, it indeed uses a bit less than what was available on the
first drives, so it looks like I'm set
     Used Dev Size : 5860390400 (5588.90 GiB 6001.04 GB)
5860521536-5860390400

Yeah, I thought of that, just don't really like it, and not sure if
mdadm -can looks for raw drives in addition to partitions

normal fdisk won't allow that, but I forgot that I can go in expert mode
and force the first sector to a value the regular tool won't allow by
default.

Thanks all for the answers and suggestions.
