If it would be a raid1 when activated, it is still a raid1 when
inactive: the data on disk doesn't suddenly become not a raid array
simply because the kernel isn't able to access it right now. This is
valuable information to expose to the sysadmin and should not be
concealed (and *certainly* not described as a raid level it actually
isn't).

I think it should say as much (if the system knows at this stage, which
if there is a device node, it presumably does).
