I suggested to skip verification at all in next comment but as you said with
WRITE_ZEROS it is not needed anyway. Sorry for being inaccurate.

Agree.

I understand that you want left shit is used to round size to data region
and I assumed that data_region is 4K and that is probably wrong.
You are right I has no sense, my apologizes.

Let's imagine that our size is for example, 2687 sectors. Left shit will
cause that we will get 2751488 and that will be passed as a size to function.
Similar for data_offset. That is much more than we want to clear.
Do I miss something? I guess that ioctl operates on sectors too but please
correct me if that is wrong.

Agree, thanks.

Ok, I missed that, thanks.
