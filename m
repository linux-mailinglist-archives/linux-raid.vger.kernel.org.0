Thanks Reindl.

Is xfs_repair an option? And, if it is, do I run it on md125 or the 
individual sd devices?

Unfortunately, restore from back up isn't an option - after all to where do 
you back up 200TB of data? This storage was originally set up with the 
understanding that it wasn't backed up and so no valuable data was supposed 
to have been stored on it. Unfortunately, people being what they are, 
valuable data has been stored there and I'm the mug now trying to get it 
back - it's a system that I've inherited.

So, any help or constructive advice would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Bob

restore from a backup - the array is one thing, the filesystem is a 
different layer and it seems to be heavily damag after all the things which 
happened
