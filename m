nonsense - the "30716928" or "Array Size" is something like K and fro 
the sake of god no matter if you take that or 29.29 G or 31.45 G you end 
up with something useful for a partition-size in fdisk so that "Array 
Size" on that new RAID1 partition is >= as on the old RAID10

no matter qhat question i asked since 2014 on that list (--writemostly, 
chagne UUID, claculate partition size) any useful response came

whatever you do ends in WAY larger or smaller "Array Size"

finally i took 30716928 / 1000 * 1024 + (10*1024) which made it sligltly 
lager buth not that too much so that the data-parition/raid after that 
has not enough space

it's ridiculous that you have to shit around 2.5 hours to get a 
partition on a new 4 TB disk nearby (gave up with exactly) the same size 
as a 4x2 TB RAID10

i can't believe that i am the only person on palent reath which ever 
wanted to switch rom 4 drive RAID10 to 2 drive RAID1 and simply dd the 
old filesystem from a live-sio from one md-device to the other
