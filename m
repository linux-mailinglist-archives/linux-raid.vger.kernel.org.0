Sure. Wasn't sure how you'd like to handle it; some prefer smaller
patches, some prefer less patches overall ...

Have to check.

Not yet, but there is a program I wrote some time ago

https://github.com/hreinecke/md_monitor.git

which currently does an 'exec' on mdadm, and error handling _that_ is a
major pain. Having a shared library will make life easier there.
And I've some projects planned which would need to leverage mdadm
functionality, so for those a mdadm library would be ideal.
