Sorry I missed this mainly because it had PATCH in the title and I
didn't feel the shared library subject was an urgent issue. I am not
opposed to splitting things into a shared library, in fact I believe I
suggested this to Neil many years ago. I don't remember why it didn't
happen at the time.

That said, I don't think it's something that is appropriate for 4.2, but
rather something to target for 5.0.

For something like this I would prefer smaller patches so it's possible
to bisect our way back if something broke in the process. Jumbo patches
are always wrong.

Cheers,
Jes
