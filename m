Possibly less? Or DEFINITELY less!

When rebuilding a mirror (of any sort), one block written requires ONE
block read. When rebuilding a parity array, one block written requires
one STRIPE read.

That's a hell of a lot more load on the machine. And when faced with a
production machine that needs to work (as opposed to a hobbyist machine
which can dedicate itself solely to a rebuild), you have the two
conflicting requirements that you need to finish the rebuild as quickly
as possible for data safety, but you also need the computer to do real
work. Minimising disk i/o is *crucial*.

This general attitude of "oh the computer can do everything, we don't
need to be efficient" is great - until it isn't. If it takes longer to
do the job than the time available, then you're in trouble ... been
there done that ...
