It would be nice, if you listed them in your proposal with solutions how 
to address them. That would have avoided them.

I do not think so. Why?

If it is that low, then I do not understand, why the infrastructure 
needs to be changed at all.

Can you please give example projects, that have implemented that on GitHub?

Has this claim ever been proven, now that a lot of projects made the 
switch. Did participation actually increase?

As written, I do not think splitting forums (for a small project) is a 
good idea.

As written above, if that is true, I do not understand the effort put 
into changing the infrastructure. The effort could have gone into 
writing the CI infrastructure for a mailing list process. Other Intel 
departments seem to do it already, so work would not need to be reinvented?

Sorry, I do not understand.

I am not convinced the theoretical more participants are outweighing the 
cost for the existing folks being happy with the current infrastructure.

Sorry, I also do not understand this statement. Is the Linux Foundation 
only supporting projects using a GitHub based workflow?


Kind regards,
