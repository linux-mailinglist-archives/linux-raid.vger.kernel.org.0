Actualy user is forced to work with MD device from the get go.
This is how you would typicaly use mdadm to write metadata to disk:

$ truncate -s 1G test.img
$ mdadm --create /dev/md0 --level=1 --bitmap=internal --raid-devices=2 test.img missing
mdadm: must be super-user to perform this action
mdadm: test.img is not a block device.

Following is unfit for my usecase:
* It requires me to reference /dev/md0 (i don't want to involve kernel at all)
* It requires super-user (no need, i just want to write bytes to my own file)
* Refuses to work on regular file (once i run it as super-user)

No it is not the goal. Goal is not to rely on kernel. It has to work on any kernel
including the ones that have MD module loaded. Possibly even on non-Linux OS.

> I agree. The right way is to incorporate it with mdadm.

In that case i would still need headers with structs to parse the metadata
and get offsets where to load actual data (filesystem) into the array images.

But to be honest, i am pretty happy with how the genimage code works now,
i don't need any help with its functionality. I don't even need those headers
to be fixed. I can leave them copypasted. But i think it would be right thing
to consolidate them, therefore i've proposed the patch.

I just didn't wanted to hardcode definitions that are already in kernel,
because i don't like duplicit code that can be included from somewhere else.

> If you are looking for challenges this software is full of them!

Haha. I feel you. Maybe lets tackle them step by step.
Consolidating headers to provide complete ondisk format seems
as a good start to me. Especialy if the mdadm could benefit from that as well.
