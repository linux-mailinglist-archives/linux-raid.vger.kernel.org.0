Okay, so that wasn't what you were thinking of then.

I haven't got anything published to back up the assertion but I
haven't really noticed very much performance difference between
RAID-10 and RAID-1 on non-rotational storage since the above fix.
Most of my storage is non-rotational these days.

I haven't got anything published to back up the assertion but I
haven't really noticed very much performance difference between
RAID-10 and RAID-1 on non-rotational storage since the above fix.
Most of my storage is non-rotational these days.

That does assume a load that isn't single-threaded, since a single
thread is only ever going to read from one half of an md RAID-1. It
doesn't stripe.

I must admit that as most of my storage has shifted from HDD to SSD
I've shifted away from md RAID-10, which I used to use even when
there were only 2 devices. With HDDs I felt (and measured) the
increased performance.

But with SSDs these days I tend to just use RAID-1 pairs and
concatenate them in LVM (which I am using anyway) afterwards. Mainly
just because it's much simpler and the performance is good enough.

If you need to eke out the most performance this is maybe not the
way. Certainly not the way if you need better redundancy (lose any
two devices etc). Many concerns, performance only one of them…

I think so but it's always good to see a recent test with numbers!

Cheers,
Andy
