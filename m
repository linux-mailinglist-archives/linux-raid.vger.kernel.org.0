That's not correct. The later "open" call actually will use the new_array
parameter which will wait for the workqueue before creating a new array
device, so the old one is properly cleaned up and there is no longer
a race condition with this patch. If new_array doesn't exist and it falls back
to a regular open, then it will still do the right thing and open the device 
with create_on_open.

I don't think that would work very well. Userspace would end up blocking
on --stop indefinitely if there are any references delaying cleanup to
the device. That's not very user friendly. Given that opening the md
device has side-effects, I think we should avoid opening when we
should know that we are about to try to create a new device.

Hmm, yes seems like I was a bit sloppy here. However, it still seems possible
to fix this up by not pre-opening the device. The only use for the mdfd
in CREATE, ASSEMBLE and BUILD is to get the minor number if
ident.super_minor == -2 and check if an existing specified device is an md 
device (which may be redundant). We could replace this with a stat() call to
avoid opening the device. What about the patch at the end of this email?

I'm glad to hear someone is still working on that. Thanks!
