Looking good!

Just one last bit of advice - if you can, get another drive. Okay, you 
may not have a bay, or a sata port, or the cash ...

Add it to the array same as before. That'll give you a 3-drive raid plus 
spare. If another drive fails, it will then just start rebuilding 
straight away.

You'll get various people saying "if you've got 4 drives, just go 
raid-6". I'm not going to advise either way, other than to say "don't do 
it just now". If you read the list archive you'll see a couple of arrays 
have got wedged upgrading - udevd quite literally threw a monkey wrench 
into the works. Looks like an easy fix, but better not to risk it - just 
wait until the problem is fixed :-)

Nice drives btw, I've got a 3-drive raid-5 plus spare setup - 3TB 
Barracuda (DON'T use those!), two by 4TB Ironwolf, and an 8TB N300.

Cheers,
Wol
