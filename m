Everything else is mirrored - you should mirror your boot setup ... you
don't want disk 0 to die, and although (almost) everything is there on
disk 1 you can't boot the system because grub/efi/whatever isn't there...

The crucial question is whether your updates to your efi partition
happen under the control of linux, or under the control of efi. If they
happen at the linux level, then they will happen to both disks together.
If they happen at the efi level, then they will only happen to disk 0,
and you will need to re-sync the mirror.

I prefer swap to be at least twice ram. A lot of people think I'm daft
for that, but it always used to be the rule things were better that way.
It's been pointed out to me that this can be used as a denial of service
(a fork bomb, for example, will crucify your system until the OOM killer
takes it out, which will take a LOOONNG time with gigs of VM). Horses
for courses.

Yup. Apart from the fact that they will probably be 126, 125 and 124 not
0, 1, 2. And if I were you I'd name them, for example EFI, SWAP, MAIN or
LVM.

I'd just use type linux ...

Sounds like you probably know this, but remember that /tmp and /var/tmp
are different - DON'T make /var/tmp a tmpfs, and use a cron job to clean
that - I made that mistake early on ... :-)

You found the kernel raid wiki, did you? You've read
https://raid.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Setting_up_a_%28new%29_system and
the pages round it? It's not meant to be definitive, but it gives you a
lot of ideas. In particular, dm-integrity. I intend to play with that a
lot as soon as I can get my new system up and running, when I'll
relegate the old system to a test-bed.

Cheers,
Wol
