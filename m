I am neutral to the change

I don't follow, did you mean --set-fault from mdadm could "damaging raid"?

IIUC, the failfast flag is supposed to be set during transient error not
permanent failure, the rdev (marked as failfast) need to be revalidated
and readded to array.

Yes, we printed two md_name here, seems unnecessary.

Or, just check if it is raid0 or linear directly instead of implies 
level with
redundancy.
