Bummer. It's a raid-10. A raid-1 would have been easier.

Seconded. And thirded and fourthed.

Actually, that might not be necessary ...

Yup. Do you need the old disks in your new system? If not, DON'T MOVE 
THEM and they'll be your backup.

Yup. If you move the disks, the UUID won't change.

What I went and did - which took some down-time because it was a pretty 
big array ... was to create my new array on new disks in the new system.

Then I can't remember the syntax - I looked it up on the web - but I 
just did a

cat //old-system/dev/old-array | network > //new-system/dev/newarray

So you're basically copying your filesystem across the network from the 
old "disk" (array, actually) to the new equivalent on the new system.

Worked a treat, apart from the time it took ...

A major reason I went that route, rather than an rsync or whatever, is 
that my system has hard-links all over the place, and while the various 
filesystem copying mechanisms CAN handle it, they don't like it ... a 
device copy simply doesn't need to know anything about it.

Cheers,
Wol
