I'd better want md to stop fixing "somebody else's problem", that is, the d=
isk, and rather just do its job. As for the case, I have tried to manually =
read those sectors named in the badblocks list and they all work. All of th=
em. But then, there's no fixing, since they are proclaimed dead. So are the=
ir siblings' sectors with the same number, regardless of status.

If a drive has multiple issues with bad sector, kick it out. It doesn't hav=
e anything to do in the RAID anymore
