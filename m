Thanks for your answer. It tells me that the observed behaviour is usual 
- no matter that I think it should not be usual. ;)

But the system does not need this disc to boot or to run. This IMO 
should not happen.

This is logical to me.

btw: I am not able to open the recovery console. I am not able to enter 
the shell.
In the Unix/Linux world all things have reasons - no matter that I do 
not know or understand all of them.
But this is systemd. ;)

I see no no reason to stop the boot process just because a unneeded 
data-only partition/drive is not available.

> Is root's home on /Daten? It shouldn't be.

No it is not. As you can see in the second line of the fstab / (and all 
its sub-content like home-dirs, boot, etc) is on /dev/sda1. The RAID is 
build of sdb and sdc.
