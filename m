Oh!  Sorry to hear that.  Not much I can do from here, but I can think
you a hug :-)  I hope things look up soon.

I've tried a couple of reboots; they're stuck that way.  I'll try the
stop and assemble.


% by an assemble. The big worry is the wildly varying event counts. Do your
% arrays have journals.

No, I don't think so, unless they're created automagically.  Alas, I
don't recall the exact creation command :-/

How can I check for usre?  The -D flag output doesn't mention a journal,
whether enabled or missing.

% If the worst comes to the worst, try a forced assemble with the minimum
% possible drives (no redundancy). Pick the drives with the highest event
% counts. You can then re-add the remaining ones if that works.

Hmmmmm ...  For a RAID5 array, the minimum would be one left out, right?
So five instead of all six.  And the event counts seem to be three and
three, which is interesting but also doesn't point to any one favorite to
drop :-/


% 
% Iirc this is actually not uncommon and it shouldn't be hard to recover from.

In your copious free time :-)  That would, indeed, be awesome.


% 
% The only real worry is that the varying event counts mean that some data
% corruption is likely. Recent files, hopefully nothing important. One thing

Gaaaaah!

Fortunately, everything is manually mirrored out to external drives, so
if everything did go tits-up I could reload.  I'll come up with a diff
using the externals as the sources and check ... eventually.


% that's just struck me, this is often caused by a drive failing some while
% back, and then a glitch on a second drive brings the whole thing down. When
% did you last check your array was fully functional?

Let me get back to you on that.  It's actually been a couple of weeks in
this state just waiting to get to it; life has been interesting here,
too.  But I have a heartbeat script that might have captured happy data
...  These are all pretty new drives after the 4T drive disaster a year
(or two?) ago, so they *should* be OK.

% Cheers,

Thanks again & stay tuned

:-D
