and that's why i asked since when it's that broken

i expect a RAID simply coming up as nothign happened as long there are 
enough disks remaining to have the complete dataset

it's also not uncommon that a disk dies between power-cycles aka simply 
don't come up again which is the same as replace it when the machine is 
powered off

i replaced a ton of disks in Linux RAID1/RAID10 setups over the years 
that way and in some cases i cloed machines by put 2 out of 4 RAID10 
disks in a new machine and insert 2 blank disks in both

* spread the disks between both machines
* power on
* login via SSH
* start rebuild the array on both
* change hostname and network config of one

for me it's an ordinary event a RAID has to cope without interaction 
*before* boot to a normal OS state and if it doesn't it's a serious bug
