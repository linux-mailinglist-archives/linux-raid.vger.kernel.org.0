=E2=80=A6or just remove the whole bbl, since it has virtually no function a=
nd didn't even have it when it was introduced 10 years ago. Even back then,=
 drives had automatic reallocation of bad sectors and even if the docs say =
the bbl is built on write errors alone, this seems to not be the case. If a=
 drive is bad, it should get thrown out, not patched up in software in the =
belief that this will make things better. That the bbl is replicated to new=
 members and thus never removed, is part of this. I posted a thread about t=
his earlier.
