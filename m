Ok thanks.  I did do a superblock backup on my 3 drives a few months ago.  I
checked offset 72 to offset 262143, it was all 0s.  I assume whatever is
there was on the disk and not wiped when I created the array.

I also dumped the same sectors from each of the disks.  interestingly, what
is stored there is the same on all 3 drives except for the areas that were
bad.

This array has never been reshaped.  It also has never had a disk replaced.

I already DD'd zero to the drive, but only the sectors that were not
readable.  Didn't see any reason not to.  I found it interesting that the
reallocated sectors didn't go up.  The drives have 13 years of power on
time.

This is mdstat:
md0 : active raid5 sda1[0] sdb1[1] sdc1[3]
      488018688 blocks super 1.1 level 5, 64k chunk, algorithm 2 [3/3] [UUU]
      bitmap: 1/2 pages [4KB], 65536KB chunk

And that is the only array on this machine.
