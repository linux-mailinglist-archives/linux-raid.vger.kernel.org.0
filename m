This is what I wanted to propose:

in makefile:
# If provided respect that, otherwise, search for it
MODPROBE_PATH ?=3D $(which modprobe)

DMODPROBE_PATH =3D $(if $(MODPROBE_PATH),-DMODPROBE_PATH=3D"\" -
$(MODPROBE_PATH)\"",)

+CFLAGS +=3D $(DVERS) $(DDATE) $(DEXTRAVERSION) $(DMODPROBE_PATH)

and finally in code:
if (system(MODPROBE_PATH " md_mod")

with that we would detect location of modprobe during compilation or
rpm building, or allow user to customize it. It assumes that location
of modprobe won't change.

I checked whether it is provided by pkg-config with no success.

Maybe we can print error then? It would be useful for programmers
to understand the problem. Sometimes, to debug early stages I simply
redirected all error messages from mdadm to /dev/kmsg.

I see, it is more theoretical problem, almost to possible to met.
All fine then, we can continue with no clean up here as I cannot find
normal scenario it can occur.

Your change (after getenv fixes) LGTM. You can take a look into concept
I proposed but I have no strong preference.

Thanks,
