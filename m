Just tried to Google it. Did I say I didn't trust WD?

It sounds like it's marketing speak designed to re-define the meaning of 
Revolutions Per Minute.

Apparently 7200rpm drives are being sold as "5400 class". Misleading 
people who are prepared to take the speed hit, into buying a drive that 
is power-hungry and noisy.

As the google page I saw said - "Why describe it as "5400-class" in a 
spec sheet - the people who don't know what it means won't be reading 
spec sheets, and the people who do read spec sheets won't know what the 
hell it means and it is deceptive".

I'd go and look for another X300, or an Ironwolf. At least you'll know 
what you're getting ...

Cheers,
Wol
