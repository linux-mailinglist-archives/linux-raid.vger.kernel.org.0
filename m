Is the  drive completely  failed out of the raid10?

With a drive missing I would only expect read issues, but if the read
load is high enough that it really needs both disks for the read load,
then that would cause the writes to be slower if the total IO
(read+write load) is overloading the disks.

With 7200 rpm disks you can do a max of about 100-150 seeks and/or
IOPS per second on each disk, any more than that and all performance
on the disks will start to back up.   It will be worse if the
application is writing sync to the disks (app guys love sync but fail
to understand how it interacts with spinning disk hardware).

Sar -d will show the disks and the tps (iops) and the wait time (7200
disk has seek time of around 5-8ms).   It will also show similar stats
on the md device itself.  If the device is getting backed up that
means that app guys failed to understand the ability of the hardware
and what their application needs.
