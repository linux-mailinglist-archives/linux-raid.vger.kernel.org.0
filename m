That's good.

And that's not so good. If your root is not on the raid and the system 
actually runs, download and run the latest mdadm. That on an old kernel 
shouldn't be a problem. A franken-kernel that's been patched to buggery 
probably is.

Do you want the good news or the bad news? The good news is we can 
probably recover your data. The bad news is you're probably looking at 
replacing all your drives :-(

https://raid.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Timeout_Mismatch

A cursory glance says you have several drives that fall foul of this. 
Again, if your system is bootable, you NEED to configure Brad's script 
to run. I'll go into it a bit deeper as I dig through your reply.

GOOD. This drive is suitable for RAID.

And BAD. Brad's script should switch this on. Check that it does!

I don't think green drives are suitable ... but it is a Caviar, which 
have a good rep ...

No mention of Error Recovery ... BAAAADDDDD!!!

BAAAAADDDDDD!!!!

Greens aren't suitable - and this is sdc, the dodgy drive, so I suspect 
using it in a raid array has knackered it.

And bad, but at least it's got it ... as above make sure it's enabled.

Okay, I assume this is the same as the previous drive ...

Okay, we'll assume sdc is dead. The first thing is to try to assemble 
the remaining disks without it. Boot from a rescue disk so you've got 
the latest and greatest available. And don't forget, if you get "device 
busy", you've probably got the remains of a previous assemble messing 
things up, so you need to do a --stop. Just DON'T do a --force, not yet.

Next thing we need is the event count - I think that's mdadm --examine 
over each partition that makes the array.

And make sure you've got a replacement for that Green. You NEED to get 
rid of it.

Let's see how it goes ... if the array assembles fine with the rescue 
disk, just add your new disk and replace sdc, but make sure Brad's 
script has enabled ERC!

Cheers,
Wol
