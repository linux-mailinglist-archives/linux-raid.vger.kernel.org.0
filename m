Gal,
My SA just gave me the server with the 5.14 RC4 kernel built.   I have a tw=
o pass preconditioning run  going right now to get us maximum results.   I =
expect to be able to run the tests hopefully by COB Wednesday.   Preconditi=
oning will take 8 hours unfortunately (15.36TB drives), I have to make BIOS=
 changes for apples to apples "hero runs" and then get the mdraid's created=
.    In your opinion, if I bypass the initial formatting with mdadm --assum=
e-clean, will that make a difference in the results?    I usually let the f=
ormat run, but I want to get you results as soon as possible.
Thanks,
Jim

Hey Jim,

Read iops (rand/seq) were addressed in a recent commit:
97ae27252f49 md/raid5: avoid device_lock in read_one_chunk() Caution-https:=
//github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/97ae27252f4962d0fcc38ee1d9f913d817a2024e
It was merged into 5.14, so you can either cherry-pick it or just use a lat=
est-master kernel.

Sounds like your environment is stronger than the one I used for the testin=
g, so please do share your benchmark if you manage to surpass the results d=
escribed in the commit message.

Cheers,
Gal Ofri,
