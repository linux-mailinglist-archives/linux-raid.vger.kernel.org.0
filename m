Does it count when you try to upgrade SLES 12.3 with the latest
patches to 15 and it bombs so badly that the btrfs snapshots can't get
you working again and you have to blow the system away to do a fresh
full re-install?  

I don't trust btrfs because when (not if) it goes badly, it goes
REALLY badly in my experience.  Where ext4 and xfs both will recover
enough to keep working.  You might lose data, but you won't lose the
entire filesystem.

It can't handle snapshots well either in my experience.

I call it a failure of the layering model.  If you want RAID, use MD.
If you want logical volumes, then put LVM on top.  Then put
filesystems into logical volumes.  

So much simpler...

So why the hell are you recommending it?

Yes, I agree 100%.  

Mirrors and backups are key.  And offsite backups are key too.
Especially for family photos and other keep sakes you don't want to
lose.  rips of CDs and DVDs aren't nearly as important in my book.
