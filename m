That's the biggest problem.  There is no way to remove sectors from the 
badblocks log.  At least, I've not seen one.  Official or otherwise.

What I don't understand is how this feature ended up in mdadm without 
any way to reverse the addition of entries, particularly since *you 
silently lose redundancy*.

> A friend of mine wrote a thing in python to remove the badblocks list from an offline array. I haven't dared to test it on a live system, but apparently it worked on his (5 drives in RAID-5 IIRC with three of them showing a list identical of badblocks). You can find the code here https://git.thehawken.org/hawken/md-badblocktool.git

This would be the first. /:
