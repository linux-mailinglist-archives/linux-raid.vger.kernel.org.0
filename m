Well, this one has sparked a bit of an argument.

I do the same. /boot and EFI are on RAID-1 0.90 partitions (ext4 and FAT32 respectively) and everything else is encrypted.

I use rEFInd as a bootloader. It *can* write to the EFI partition to record preferences and settings which can see the RAID out of sync, but it's rare I see that.
In practice this doesn't cause an issue and if the monthly raid check indicates a mismatch I just correct it with a "repair".

In my case the RAID for EFI is for availability.
If I drop a disk the system will still boot regardless of the settings in the partition, and as rEFInd reads its config file from /boot there is no need to write to EFI at all save for upgrading the bootloader.

Regards,
Brad
