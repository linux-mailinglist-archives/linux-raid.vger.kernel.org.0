If you've got python 2.7, can you run lsdrv? Hopefully that will give us 
some more clues.

Provided the data itself isn't damaged, you should be able to retrieve 
your array. Read up the section on overlays, that will protect your data 
from being overwritten while you play around trying to recover it.

The other thing I would do here, is five drives is a lot to try and get 
right. I'd pick just three drives, and try to get them to assemble 
correctly (using overlays for safety!). Once you've got three drives to 
give you a functional array, you can then try and get the other two 
correct before the final recovery.

What can you remember about the system? What version of superblock? And 
something I've noticed that seems weird, why do your drives have 
partitions 1 & 9, but not 2-8? That is well odd ... Have you rebuilt the 
array in any way, or is it exactly as originally created? Etc etc the 
more information you can give us the better.

Let us know how you get on with this, and then we'll come back with more.

Cheers,
Wol
