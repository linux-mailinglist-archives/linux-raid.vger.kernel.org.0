I think it has screwed me a bit already, but then, I didn't check until rec=
ently. I didn't even know about this "feature". But doesn't help much when =
those "badblocks" are recorded already. What would be the official way to r=
emove them apart from rebuild the whole array?

A friend of mine wrote a thing in python to remove the badblocks list from =
an offline array. I haven't dared to test it on a live system, but apparent=
ly it worked on his (5 drives in RAID-5 IIRC with three of them showing a l=
ist identical of badblocks). You can find the code here https://git.thehawk=
en.org/hawken/md-badblocktool.git
