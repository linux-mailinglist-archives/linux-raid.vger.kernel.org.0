Yes. The WD Red line was always advertised as "optimised for raid" 
(which was debatable, but okay), then they switched it to SMR. So the 
notice was saying "keep away !!!". I think several new SMR Reds failed 
badly when people tried to rebuild their array.

If you look at what SMR is, it's only relevant to spinning rust. It 
relies on the fact that a read head can be much smaller than a write 
head, so provided you shingle your writes (hence the name), you can 
over-write half the previous track (so saving space) without rendering 
the data unreadable.

The problem is you have to stream your writes, you can't go back, which 
is why these drives - especially the early ones - had a habit of 
stalling for minutes on end, as they shuffled stuff around.

I'm not sure how true that is now, I've not been keeping up. But about 
that time (2020), most desktop drives - the sort that don't have TLER - 
were transitioning to SMR. Hence the warning following immediately - 
don't use desktop drives! I suspect non-SMR is now a premium feature 
which will usually come with TLER as a matter of course.

As I say, I'm not up-to-date any more. If anybody can give me some 
facts, I'll happily update the site.

Cheers,
