IF mdraid RESYNC ran as fast as the SSDs, but it doesn't :)

While there is little to no pentalty for running multiple concurrent IO str=
eams to the SSD, there is nothing gained by doing so either.  In other word=
s, if you are trying to resync both mirrors on different parts of two SSDs =
at the same time, each one will go half as fast, and will take the same amo=
unt of time to finish both.
