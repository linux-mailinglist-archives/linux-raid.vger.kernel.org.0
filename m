Well, that's an interesting approach :-)

Right.

Hmmmm...  OK.  Yes, that makes sense (logically, anyway!).

Aha!  NOW I start to see it.  So you set up two mirrors each with only
one disk, and then you stripe them, and you get the full size before
later adding the other side of each mirror.  Right?

So it's not an end goal configuration :-)


Thanks again & HAND
