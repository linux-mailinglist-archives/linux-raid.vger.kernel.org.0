Thank Wol.

Should I use a CentOS 7 disk or a CentOS disk?

Thanks

What you need to do is revert the reshape. I know what may have happened,=

and what bothers me is your kernel version, 3.10.

The first thing to try is to boot from up-to-date rescue media and see if=
 an=20
mdadm --revert works from there. If it does, your Centos should then brin=
g=20
everything back no problem.

(You've currently got what I call a Frankensetup, a very old kernel, a=20
pretty new mdadm, and a whole bunch of patches that does who knows what.
You really need a matching kernel and mdadm, and your frankenkernel won't=
=20
match anything ...)

Let us know how that goes ...

Cheers,
Wol
