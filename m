Yes, that is my guess too if the message appears but there is no read 
issue from component device.

IIUC, the rdev is set in raid10_run instead of before dispatch IO request.

I think check if raid10_read_request is called from read error path is 
enough.

If the message ("redirecting sector ...") is not comes from handle read 
err path, then I suppose the message is false alarm.
