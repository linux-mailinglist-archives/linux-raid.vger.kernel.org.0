If we want to keep this, we need to resolve reboot problem. I described pro=
blem
and now I'm waiting for feedback. I hope that it can be fixed in mdmon serv=
ice
fast and easy.
I we will determine that mdmon design update is needed then I will request =
to
revert it, until fix is not ready to minimize impact on users (distros may
pull this).

Thanks
