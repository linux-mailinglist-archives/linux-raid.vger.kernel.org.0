My configuration uses one RAID1 for /boot, another RAID1 partition for /boot/efi, and a third one for the rest which also uses LVM and LUKS. I actually used a DVD image of Centos 7 (minimal installation) to accomplish this which also completed the minimal installation of the OS on the new disks. It boots as expected and the RAID partitions seem to work as expected.

However, I expect that to also transfer all OS files using the old, now incorrect UUIDs, to the new disks after which nothing will work, thus I have not yet done that. I could erase the minimal installation of the OS on the new disks before rsyncing but have not yet done so.

I have some knowledge of linux but could use some help and advice. For instance, I expect that /etc/fstab and /etc/crypttab would need to be edited reflecting the UUIDs of the new disks, partitions and LUKS, but which other files? Grub2 would also need to be edited I would think.

What I cannot do, however, is to make any modifications to the existing old SSD since I cannot afford not being able to go back to the old SSD if necessary.

Upon further thinking, I am wondering if the process below would work? As stated above, I have two working disk setups in the same computer and depending on the order of disks in the BIOS I can boot any of the two setups.

My existing setup uses one disk and no RAID (obviously), LUKS and LVM for everything but /boot and /boot/efi, total of three partitions. The OS is Centos 7 and I have made a complete backup to an external harddisk using rsync ("BACKUP1").

The new one uses two disks, RAID1, LUKS and LVM for everything but /boot and /boot/efi, total of four partitions (swap has its own partition - not sure why I made it that way). A minimal installation of Centos 7 was made to this setup and is working. In other words, UUIDs of disks, partitions and LUKS are already configured and working.

So, I am now thinking the following might work:

- Make a rsync backup of the new disks to the external harddisk ("BACKUP2").

- Delete all files from the new disks except from /boot and /boot/efi.

- Copy all files from all partitions except /boot and /boot/efi from BACKUP1 to the new disks. In other words, everything except /boot and /boot/efi will now be overwritten.

- I would expect this system not to boot since both /etc/fstab and /etc/crypttab on the new disks contain the UUIDs from the old system.

- Copy just /etc/fstab and /etc/crypttab from BACKUP2 to the new disks. This should update the new disks with the previously created UUIDs from when doing the minimal installation of CentOS 7.

What do you think?
