I don't trust WD. That said, a lot of people do. I've got two 4TB 
Ironwolves, one 3TB Barracuda (slap wrist!), and one 8TB X300.

So mixing drives isn't a problem - just take a look at the Ironwolf - 
that might give you extra capacity too.

Drives now are "Constant Head Speed" not constant rpm. I'm guessing, 
that what it means is that for the inner tracks it spins at 7200, and as 
the heads move out, the rpms slow down to keep the speed the head is 
going over the platter constant.
