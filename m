This reads wrong. The grammar is correct either way, but combined with 
the 4KB requirement it just doesn't feel right at all.

"require the chunk size in KB to be a power of 2 and at least 4KB." The 
"multiple" is implied by that and not necessary.

If you read it out loud, does it feel like breaking at that point would 
improve comprehension? If you're not a native speaker it can be very 
hard to make the call. Or more importantly, would breaking at that point 
hinder comprehension (I'm thinking of the English translator, listening 
to a German speaker, and waiting for an interminable sentence to finish 
so he could put the verb in. For people who don't know the two 
languages, English puts the verb at the start, German puts it at the 
end, so a long German sentence in a speech is a nightmare to translate :-)

This entire section isn't actually comprehensible. What I *think* it is 
saying is

This option is intended to be used in start-up scripts during the initrd 
boot phase. When the array under reshape is assembled during the initrd 
phase, this option stops the reshape after the reshape-critical section 
has been restored. This happens before the file system pivot operation 
and avoids the loss of file system context. Losing the file system 
context would cause reshape to be broken.

NOTE I changed the tense of "is being". We have a past tense occurring 
after a continuous present, so something is being forced through a time 
warp.

That one was tricky. But it breaks neatly into sections, which feel

But I have a problem - "a number of" is almost certainly wrong. It's 
either "the" or "some of the". "some of the" implies mdadm will find the 
rest on its own, "the" implies that you have to provide a list of all of 
them (or none). I'd  be inclined to use "the" so it's consistent.

Then look at the entire section and see if we can improve it.

Given that 2.6 was a long time ago, can we move this into the past

That was a marathon! :-)

If you want to revert my nacks, you can add a reviewed - "Wol 
<anthony@youngman.org.uk>" (I use my proper email name, not assorted 
aliases, for real code ...)

Stick the other changes in a new patch, and I'll review those.
