Hello Roger, All,

Thanks for your response.

Yes, the scenario is when the drive completely fails out of raid10. I
know it's not right to approach to run an array with a failed drive.
But what I am trying to understand is, how to benchmark the
performance hit in such a condition.
It's always a priority for us to get the failed drive replaced.

We run kafka brokers on these machines to be specific on the type of
the workload it is handling.
