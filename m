Hi Wol,

Not particularly. I have taken backups and I am reshaping it to 5 raid
devices and if it works, I'll keep it.

I don't know, Wol. I added the option because the wiki recommended it.
All I know is that when I tried to resume the reshape without the
option or without the --invalid-backup option, mdadm complained it
could not restore the critical section and refused to assemble the
array.

I am no longer going to rely on the array alone to keep my data safe.
Should this array ever fail again, there will be backups to recover
from.

Thanks,

    Johan
