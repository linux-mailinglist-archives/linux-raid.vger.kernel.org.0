Yep. That worried me, too. I did the command to show the RAID status of the two
partitions and, sure enough, both partitions were now listed as RAID0.

Sorry about that. I have two systems: the one I'm typing on and the one
I am trying to bring up. At the moment, I'm in single user mode building
out a new /home file system. mdadm --create is 15% done after an hour :(.
It'll be mid/late afternoon before /home is rebuilt, mounted and I'll be
able to run display commands on the "old" RAID1 (or 0) partitions.

> Especially lsdrv. That tells us a LOT about your system.

Expect email in about 6 hours or so. :) But openSUSE doesn't know
about any "lsdrv" command. "cat /proc/mdstat" shows /dev/md1 (the
RAID device I'm fretting over) to be active, raid-0 using /dev/sdc1 and sde1.

I *think* it was EXT4, but. it might be the XFS one. I think I let it default
and openSUSE appears to prefer the XFS file system for RAID devices.
Definitely one of those two. I built it close to a decade ago, so I'll be moving
the data to the new /home array.

In retrospect, I ought to have left the drives unplugged until the install was
done. The installer saw that they were RAID so it RAID-ed them. Only it
seems to have decided on type 0 over type 1. I wasn't attentive because
I've upgraded Linux so many times and it was "just done correctly" without
having to give it a lot of thought. "If only" I'd thought to back up
email and ssh.
(1.5TB of photos are likely okay.)

Thank you so much for your reply and potentially help :)
