Subject: md-linear accidental(?) removal, removed significant(?) use case?
To: Song Liu <song@kernel.org>, Yu Kuai <yukuai3@huawei.com>, linux-raid@vger.kernel.org,

Preamble: I have extensive arrays of drives and due to their irregular
sizes, I was using md-linear as a convenient way to manually
concatenate arrays of underlying MD (raid5/etc) to manually deal with
redundancy.

I have probably a few thousand TB in total raw space, and hundreds of
TB of actual data and files attached to singular systems.

In a recent OS update, I discovered my larger volumes no longer mount
because md-linear has been removed entirely from the kernel as of 6.8.

I am trying to do rationale archaeology. I sent a note to Mr. Neil
Brown who was responsible for the earliest change I found related to
this and he suggested I email regressions and linux-raid along with
the current maintainers about it.

What I've been able to find:

In 2604b703b6b3db80e3c75ce472a54dfd0b7bf9f4 (2006) Neil Brown marked a
MODULE_ALIAS entry for md-personality-1 as deprecated but it appears
the reason was because the form of the personality was changed (not
that the underlying md-linear itself was deprecated.)

d9d166c2a9d5d01af34396793950aa695883eed4 (2006) reinforced this change
via a diff algorithm that overzealously included that line in a diff
chunk but which makes annotating prior to it a more manual process.

608f52e30aae7dc8da836e5b7b112d50a2d00e43 (2021) marked md-linear as
deprecated in Kconfig, using the rationale that md-linear was
deprecated in MODULE_ALIAS=E2=80=94but again which doesn't explain why the
*module* was deprecated and appears to me at least to accidentally
misconstrue the original reason for the deprecation comment.

849d18e27be9a1253f2318cb4549cc857219d991 (2023) eliminated md-linear
entirely, again mostly self-referencing a deprecation notice which was
there in actuality for basically multiple decades and seems to have
referenced something else entirely.

I was hoping you could help me understand why this module was removed?
I have found others who also are running into this. Functionality they
relied on has disappeared, as per the existence of the following:

https://github.com/dougvj/md-linear

https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/packaging/packages/linux/-/issues/34
https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=3D294005
(etc)

So, it looks like there are many of us who were still using mdadm to
manage sub-device concatenation, again in my case for 100s of TB of
admittedly casual data storage, and I can't currently find what the
actual actual rationale was for removing it. :(

For utility's sake, I would like to suggest that linear volumes lessen
problems like substriping. I do not think for many of us that
shuffling around a few hundred TB is easy to do at any rate. Currently
I'm manually re-compiling a fairly heavily-modified md-linear as a
user-built module and it seems to work okay. I am definitely not the
only one doing this.

Please consider resurrecting md-linear. :-)

Thank you,
Sincerely,
