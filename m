I linked to that earlier in the thread

It is neither hunted down nor fixed. It's the same thing and it has stayed =
the same for these years.

I have tried several things and all show the same. I just don't know how to=
 tell md "this drive's sector X is bad, so flag it so".

Again, this is not the way to walk around a problem. What this does is just=
 hiding real problems and let them grow in generations instead of just flag=
ging a bad drive as bad, since that's the originating problem here.
