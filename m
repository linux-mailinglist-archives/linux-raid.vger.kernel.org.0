Okay. May I suggest that

(1) try getting rid of mdadm.conf - temporarily - and see if everything 
boots fine.

(2) see if you can hard-rename (as in force an update to the metadata) 
the array to a named array eg something like "zym:data"

If you can do (2), then (1) will boot and the array will come up as 
/dev/md/data.

At which point you will be able to move the disks across and everything 
should "just work".

Note that in the modern world your arrays should not be named md1, md2 
etc, as I said. The default numbers count down from - as I said - I 
think 127, and you're advised not to use numbers. I created my original 
arrays as 0, 1, 2 and promptly found they came back as 127, 126, and 125.

I don't know whether advising you to "not have an mdadm.conf" is a good 
idea, but I've never had one, and storing things like array name in the 
metadata is much better than having it stored in an external file.

And it means you won't have clashing names :-) Actually, if you use 
mdadm.conf to rename the arrays you're moving up to md3 or md4, see if 
they boot fine on the old system, and again you can then just dd your 
system across, then move the raid drives across, and you shouldn't have 
any problems.

Cheers,
Wol
