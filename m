Well, it's a new system that's about three years old ... it's a 
home-built, most of which I bought about three years ago, and I'm 
finally finishing off commissioning it.

The hard drives are new Seagate Ironwolves x2 and an old Barracuda, 32GB 
of new DDR4 ram, and a Radeon 4350 video card which is also old but 
hardly used.

Hardware bought for this system is being re-purposed into a raid 
test-bed so I will hopefully have one available soon (if anyone in SE 
London has any 1TB drives they don't want, they'll be welcome for 
this... :-)

Pretty much. There are utilities that make it un-necessary, but it's 
easy enough and encouraged ... so my trouble COULD be as simple as a 
misconfigured kernel ...

But all this will be a learning experience :-)
