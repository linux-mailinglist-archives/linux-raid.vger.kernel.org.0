Yes, I am using 0.9 superblocks, because in-kernel auto detection does
not support the newer 1.x superblock formats.

Using an initrd would add considerable additional complexity and
resource consumption to a configuration that until recently (some time
since linux 5.5.3) just worked.  Yes, I know that the general approach
for common distros is to use initrd, but for my use case it is not
appropriate.

The problem is not with in-kernel assembly and starting of the array -
that works perfectly well.  However, when the 'md' driver assembles and
runs the partitionable array device (typically /dev/md_d0) it only
causes the array device itself to get registered with the block layer.
The assembled array is not then scanned for partitions until something
accesses the device, at which point the pending GD_NEED_PART_SCAN flag
in the array's block-device structure causes the probe for a partition
table to take place and the partitions to become accessible.

Without my patch, there does not appear to be anything between array
assembly and root mount that will access the array and cause the
partition probe operation.

To be clear, the situation is that the array has been fully assembled
and activated but the partitions it contains remain inaccessible.

Neither the 0.9 superblock format, nor the in-kernel array detection
process, are marked as deprecated in the kernel Kconfig - indeed
automatic raid detection still defaults to enabled when 'md' is enabled.

My patch is intended as a minimally-invasive fix to a functional
regression - this used to work and the kernel sources/documentation say
it should still work, but in practice (without the patch) it doesn't.

There was a relatively recent change that removed code which
deliberately performed partition probing after assembly in one of the
two code paths, but according to the patch it was only removed on the
basis that it was unclear why the probing was done; I suspect that this
regression may be partly due to that change. My patch effectively
reinstates the same functionality in that code path and adds the same
functionality to the other code path.
