We should be able to make this work.
We don't need mdmon after the last array stops, and we should have
dependencies to tell systemd that the various arrays require mdmon.
Ideally systemd wouldn't even try to stop mdmon until the relevant array
was stopped.

Can we change the udev rule to tell systemd that the device WANTS
mdmon@foo.service??
Or add "Before=3Dsys-devices-md-%I.device" or something like that to
mdmon@.service ??

Do you know what exactly is causing systemd to hang because mdmon cannot
be stopped?  What other unit is waiting for it?

Even if the root filesystems is on LVM on IMSM, doesn't systemd chroot
back to the initramfs and then tear down the LVM and MD arrays???
