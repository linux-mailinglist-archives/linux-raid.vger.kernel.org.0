md_bitmap_startwrite() is used to tell the bitmap code that the raid
module is about to start writing at a location.  This may result in
md_bitmap_file_set_bit() being called to set a bit in the in-memory copy
of the bitmap, and to make that page of the bitmap as BITMAP_PAGE_DIRTY.

Before raid actually submits the writes to the device it will call
md_bitmap_unplug() which will submit the writes and wait for them to
complete.

The is a comment at the top of md/raid5.c titled "BITMAP UNPLUGGING"
which says a few things about how raid5 ensure things happen in the
right order.

However I don't think if any sort of bitmap can solve the write-hole
problem for RAID5 - even in btrfs.

The problem is that if the host crashes while the array is degraded and
while some write requests were in-flight, then you might have lost data.
i.e.  to update a block you must write both that block and the parity
block.  If you actually wrote neither or both, everything is fine.  If
you wrote one but not the other then you CANNOT recover the data that
was on the missing device (there must be a missing device as the array
is degraded).  Even having checksums of everything is not enough to
recover that missing block.

You must either:
 1/ have a safe duplicate of the blocks being written, so they can be
   recovered and re-written after a crash.  This is what journalling
   does.  Or
 2/ Only write to location which don't contain valid data.  i.e.  always
   write full stripes to locations which are unused on each device.
   This way you cannot lose existing data.  Worst case: that whole
   stripe is ignored.  This is how I would handle RAID5 in a
   copy-on-write filesystem.

However, I see you wrote:
> Thus as long as no device is missing, a write-intent-bitmap is enough to

That doesn't make sense.  If no device is missing, then there is no
write hole.
If no device is missing, all you need to do is recalculate the parity
blocks on any stripe that was recently written.  In md with use the
write-intent-bitmap.  In btrfs I would expect that you would already
have some way of knowing where recent writes happened, so you can
validiate the various checksums.  That should be sufficient to
recalculate the parity.  I've be very surprised if btrfs doesn't already
do this.

So I'm somewhat confuses as to what your real goal is.
