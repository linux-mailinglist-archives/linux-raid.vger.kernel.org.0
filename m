When developing 'md_monitor' (https://github.com/hreinecke/md_monitor) 
I've also created an extensive testsuite for it.
The one thing which I found particularly painful is error handling once 
mdadm fails. It's really hard to figure out _what_ went wrong, and more 
often than not mdadm simply locked up on me (try to stall I/O on one 
component device while md is running and you are in a world of pain).

That's when I started to split mdadm into a library, as then we could 
have a python binding and the life would so much more fun.
So maybe I should resurrect that patchset.

Cheers,

Hannes
