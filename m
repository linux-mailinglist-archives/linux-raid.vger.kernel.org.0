Hello,
The maintenance of sedcli has been given to SK Hynix. Intel is no longer
an owner. Hannes, you can reconsider the decision of packaging libsed
depending on how active new maintainer will be.
Thanks to Paul for making this happen.

We will watch the upstream activity too to determine if it is reasonable to
consider making it as mdadm dependency in the future.

Thanks,
Mariusz
