DON'T mirror /boot. Unless you use 0.9 layout. It just makes setting up 
the boot more complicated. If anything goes wrong, 0.9 allows you to 
boot with no raid support.

128GB of ram? Why bother with a swapfile? Okay, I would create two 128GB 
swap partitions and set them equal priority, but that's me.

And what are you doing about /var? Does it really belong in the / partition?

With a 4TB setup, especially with a workstation, combining /, /var. and 
/home might be a sensible option. As I say, keep /boot out of it, but a 
single 3.5TB partition for everything else makes a lot of sense. How 
likely are you to run out of disk space? Highly unlikely? Then go for 
it! Remember most of the advice about Unix partitioning stems from the 
fact that K&R or T or whoever it was created the initial partitioning 
scheme simply because they were running out of space on a (by today's 
standards) tiny disk drive. Why stick with what they were forced to do?

Cheers,
Wol
