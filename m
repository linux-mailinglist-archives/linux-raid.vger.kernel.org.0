Except (1) I didn't say *H*D*D* trim, and (2) if raid just passes trim 
through to the layer below, THAT'S NOT SUPPORTING TRIM. As far as I'm 
concerned, what happens at the level below is just not relevant!

If raid supports trim, that means it intercepts the trim commands, and 
uses it to keep track of what's being used by the layer above.

In other words, if the filesystem is only using 10% of the disk, 
supporting trim means that raid knows which 10% is being used and only 
bothers syncing that!

Cheers,
Wol
