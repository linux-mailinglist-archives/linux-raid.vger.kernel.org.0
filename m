Seeing as no-one else has commented - you don't happen to have a spare 
disk by any chance? In that case you simply create a new 6TB partition 
on your new disk, and do a replace. You can then rinse and repeat with 
the disk you've just freed.

Otherwise, what I think you do is ... SHUT DOWN THE ARRAY. I *think* you 
can increase the partition size by deleting the old 3TB partition then 
just creating a new one starting in exactly the same place. Do it on one 
disk, test it by restarting the array. If it works, rinse and repeat on 
the second disk.

You now have a 3TB array on 2 6TB partitions. You should be able to do 
an "mdadm --grow" on the array - no need to specify the size as it 
should default to 6TB - to make a 6TB array. There are reports that 
might fail - a reboot should fix that - and you can now grow your 
filesystem to use the whole array.

Cheers,
Wol
