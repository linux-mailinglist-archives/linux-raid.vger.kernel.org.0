I suggest you read up on what the timeout mismatch problem really is.

And why doesn't mdadm just mark a device as failed? - the problem is it 
does EXACTLY THAT! And it is doing that that will destroy your parity 
raid if you are unlucky.

The whole point of the mismatch problem is that the kernel timeout MUST 
be GREATER than the drive timeout. Modern desktop drives do NOT have a 
configurable timeout which, with modern shingled drives, can be measured 
in TENS of MINUTES.

Cheers,
Wol
