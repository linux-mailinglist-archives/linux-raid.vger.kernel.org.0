If your system should not swap, then why use any swap at all ?

Cleaning /tmp is not the same as loosing access to it. Opened files are 
still accessible.

Use RAID, so that the system does not crash when a drive fails.

I think you do not need a good reason to have swap on RAID when all the 
rest is on RAID. It is the other way around : you need a good reason not 
to have swap on RAID.

Because you may not want anything to crash when a drive fails while the 
swap is used. If you don't care, well, don't protect the swap.
