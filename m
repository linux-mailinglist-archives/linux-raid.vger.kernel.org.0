Seeing as I guess most people here have plenty of experience with dead 
drives ...

My 8TB N300 arrived a couple of days ago. I've just tried to add it into 
my system, and ...

When I powered up the system I heard a "clackety clackety clack" noise.
The system hung on boot, didn't get as far as grub.
I could hear a steady repeated "boom chacka boom chacka ..." coming from 
the new drive.

I'm guessing the drive is dead and it's an RMA? I've never heard sounds 
like that from a drive before ...

Cheers,
Wol
