Hi Kuai,
=46rom the last part I understand that in case of resync/reshape frozen threa=
d is
unblocked, not restarted.

I miss some explanation about that here. So far I understand is:

"Setting "resync" or "reshape" allow to continue frozen sync_thread instead
restarting it. Setting "resync" if resync is done, has same effect as "idle=
" so
it is safe."

Please describe setting "reshape", I can see that you use it in one place, I
think that with reshape we need to be more careful but you are the expert h=
ere,
maybe it is same as "resync"?

Ok, so this is kind of preparing for kernel fix. Got it.

I think that I understand purpose of the change. You are trying to avoid th=
read
restarting if not needed and remove reference to incorrect "idle" usage of
mdadm.
Unfortunately, the changes you need to make have strong reference to kernel
implementation. It requires to well describe them because blame is volatile.

I would like to propose separate enum to not rely on kernel states naming, =
some
proposals:

/* So far I understand write "resync" for both cases */
SYNC_ACTION_RESYNC_START
SYNC_ACTION_RESYNC_CONTINUE

/* So far I understand write "reshape" for both cases *
SYNC_ACTION_RESHAPE_START
SYNC_ACTION_RESHAPE_CONTINUE

/* Highlight known bug in comment and use "resync"? /*
SYNC_ACTION_IDLE
/* If needed? */
SYNC_ACTION_ABORT

It needs to be handled by proper function which will have comments describi=
ng
what is written to kernel and why. In userspace, I need more user/reader
friendly code.
I want to know what we exactly requested from kernel. In some cases we would
expect to restart thread is some other cases just to continue frozen one. I
would like to know what was a purpose of request in the particular case eve=
n if
now the same action is used behind.

Let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Mariusz
