Are these 1tb files VMDK or COW images of VMs?  How are these files
made.  And does it ever happen with *smaller* files?  What about if
you just use a sparse 2tb file and write blocks out past 1tb to see if
there's a problem?

Are the LVs split across RAID5 PVs by any chance?  

It's not clear if you can replicate the problem without using
lvm-thin, but that's what I suspect you might be having problems with.

Can you give us the versions of the your tools, and exactly how you
setup your test cases?  How long does it take to find the problem?

Can you compile the newst kernel and newest thin tools and try them
out?

How long does it take to replicate the corruption?  

Sorry for all the questions, but until there's a test case which is
repeatable, it's going to be hard to chase this down.

I wonder if running 'fio' tests would be something to try?

And also changing your RAID5 setup to use the default stride and
stripe widths, instead of the large values you're using.

Good luck!

Or perhaps "corruption" is not the correct word - the files simply have precise 4kb (1 page) of incorrect data. The incorrect pieces of data look on their own fine - as something that was previously in the place, or written from wrong source.
