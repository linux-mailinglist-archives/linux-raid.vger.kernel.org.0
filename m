I don't see how it is easier. Also, USB sticks are not reliable.
However you are right that you can get rid of the current /boot array; I 
don't see the need for a separate /boot, its contents could be included 
in the root filesystem.

Software is not natively supported by EFI boot but there are a few 
tricks to set up a redundant EFI boot: create independent EFI partitions 
on each disk, or create a RAID 1 array with metadata 1.0 (at the end of 
the partition) so that the UEFI firmware can see each RAID partition as 
a normal EFI partition with a FAT filesystem.

I would not convert existing arrays. Rather create new arrays on the new 
disks and copy the data.
