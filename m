Hi John,

Thank you for your quick response, I'll try to elaborate further.
What we are trying to understand is if there is a potential race
between reads and writes when mirroring 2 devices.
This is unrelated to the fact that the write was not acked.

The scenario is: let's assume we have a reader R and a writer W and 2
MD devices A and B. A and B are managed under a device M which is
configured to use A and B as mirrors (RAID 1). Currently, we have some
data on A and B, let's call it V1.

W issues a write (V2) to the managed device M
The driver sends the write both to A and B at the same time.
The write to device A (V2) completes
R issues a read to M which directs it to A and returns the result (V2).
Now the driver and device A fail at the same time before the write
ever gets to device B.

When the driver recovers all it is left with is device B so future
reads will return older data (V1) than the data that was returned to
R.

Thanks,
Asaf
