Yes, it is often the reality of life, and we can always correct 
ourselves if there is problem 😎.

Thanks for deep thinking about it, I think we can avoid to call 
kthread_stop with spinlock
held. Maybe something like this, but just my raw idea, please have a 
thorough review.

  void md_unregister_thread(struct md_thread **threadp)
  {
-       struct md_thread *thread = *threadp;
-       if (!thread)
+       struct md_thread *thread = READ_ONCE(*threadp);
+
+       spin_lock(&pers_lock);
+       if (!thread) {
+               spin_unlock(&pers_lock);
                 return;
+       }
         pr_debug("interrupting MD-thread pid %d\n", 
task_pid_nr(thread->tsk));
         /* Locking ensures that mddev_unlock does not wake_up a
          * non-existent thread
          */
-       spin_lock(&pers_lock);
         *threadp = NULL;
         spin_unlock(&pers_lock);

-       kthread_stop(thread->tsk);
+       if (IS_ERR_OR_NULL(thread->tsk)) {
+               kthread_stop(thread->tsk);
+               thread->tsk = NULL;
+       }
         kfree(thread);
  }
  EXPORT_SYMBOL(md_unregister_thread);

Me either 😉
