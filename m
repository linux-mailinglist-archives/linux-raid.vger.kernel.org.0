The thing that jumps out at me from that is while SMART is available and 
enabled, it should list a bunch of SMART settings, including SCT/ERC. I 
can't see that. That's worrying.

A quick google also says these are old drives, which may or not be a 
concern. That also possibly explains the lack of sct/erc.

Given that you say three drives all failed in the first slot? My money 
would actually be on nothing to do with raid, but a dodgy cable or 
motherboard connector. I don't think they're rated at being swapped over 
that many times ...

I don't know how much help this website will be for you, but take a look...

You've already done some of what this asks for, and I don't actually 
know that the rest of this will be much use ...
