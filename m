Bear in mind you're better off using a journal (and bitmaps and journals 
are incompatible).

"not ext4" seems odd to me because - from a kernel point of view - ext's 
2 and 3 no longer longer exist.

Umm... don't use all the space on your 6TB disks. I'm planning to build 
my arrays on dm-integrity, which will make raid 5 a bit more trustworthy.

Ny new system? 4TB disks, with one terabyte raided and lvm on top for 
root partitions (I'll be configuring it multi-boot or VMs...). Then 
three terabytes with dm-integrity at the bottom, then raid, then lvm on 
top for /home and backup snapshots.

Cheers,
