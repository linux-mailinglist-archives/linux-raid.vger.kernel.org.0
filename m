Suck it and see ...

The two drives look like they report the same User Capacity, ie 6 
terabytes "exactly". They should therefore be drop-in replacements for 
each other.

And I find that eg when I partition a drive it reports unusable space at 
the end - you should find that any lost space will get lost there ...

And are you using sdk, or sdk1, as your block device to add to the 
array? While I'd be a little surprised, is it possible the disk drives 
are reporting different geometries and messing up fdisk's default 
partition sizes? Try copying the partition geometry exactly from sdi to 
sdk using sector numbers ...

Plus they're both Seagates (Ironwolf, good choice :-), so there really 
shouldn't be a problem. The only odd thing I notice is your new drive 
seems to have an older firmware?

Cheers,
Wol
