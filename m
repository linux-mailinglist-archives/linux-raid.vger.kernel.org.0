So does it have a BBU? (Battery backup unit)

I'd expect that on the contrary, you should look for ways to enable it, and
force-enable even without that BBU (in case of lack of one), because it feels
like what you did is disable disks' own write buffering, and not (only) the
card's!

What you are observing seems to me like what "dd" does with "oflag=dsync" (and
comparable performance that it gets). Definitely feels like it's in some
"extra safe mode" and, say, every 4KB piece of data leads to full flush to
disk before accepting to write the next 4KB.

More things to try, check if it's possible to set up disks not as 1-member
RAID0, but 1-member "linear" ("JBOD"), or even 1-member RAID1, who knows maybe
some of this would work better.
