Replying to myself:

Looks like batching is happening for me, it's just that when I tried to
test it and trace it through, the chunk size was too large and the
amount of data was too low such that there was not enough to fill up the
other disks in the chunk.

When running larger jobs batching seems to work correctly, but with
larger chunks stripe heads might be handled before the rest of the batch
is added.

So I'm back to square one trying to find some performance improvements
on the write path.

Thanks,

Logan
