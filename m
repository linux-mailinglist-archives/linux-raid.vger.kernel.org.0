I noticed in my kernel logs tonight that one of my disks had a medium
error trying to read sector 2160 on /dev/sdd.  It appears that the
kernel retried the read request about 20 times and each time it failed
again.  After running an mdadm repair the error seems to have been
corrected and smartctl shows that the drive has had no reallocated
sectors, so I assume that either there was a power failure in the middle
of writing this sector, or the data became corrupted later, but there
isn't anything pysically wrong with the disk.  I am left with some
questions:

1)  Why did the scsi layer retry the request 20 times before finally
giving up, and then I guess md read the data from another drive?  My
understanding is that drive firmware will internally retry a number of
times before actually returning an error to the kernel.  At that point,
further reatries seem futile.  AFAIK, this is why there are some knobs
somewhere these days to instruct the drive to give up after some
reasonable time instead of continuing to retry internally, and some
knobs to tell the kernel to give up software retries.  Why is it not
just the default for the kernel to either accept the error when the
drive returns it, or at most, retry once or twice?

2)  The errored sector in this case was sector 2160 on sdd.  Partition 1
on sdd starts at sector 2048 and is part of an mdadm raid10.  That means
that the error is at sector 112 relative to /dev/sdd1, and mdadm -E
/dev/sdd1 says that data offset = 32768 sectors, unused space before =
32680 sectors.  So doesn't that mean that the errored sector isn't even
used?  So why was it being read?

This is the full mdadm -E output for /dev/sdd1:
