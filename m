What I mentioned was only related to the source code.

Before force_remove() is removed, it was called on 2 locations, one was from
remove_from_member_array(), another was from IncrementalRemove().

But remove_from_member_array() was called from IncrementalRemove() too. The
code flow is,

	if (container) {
		call remove_from_member_array()
	} else {
		call Manage_subdevs() with 'I' operation.
		if (return 2)
			call force_remove()
	}
		
	call Manage_subdevs() with 'r' operation

From the above bogus code, the first call to Manage_subdevs() was an Incremental
remove, and the second call to Manage_subdevs() was a hot remove. No matter it
succeed or failed on the first call, the second call for hot remove will always
happen.

Therefore, after removing force_remove(), it is unnecessary to check the return
value of the first call to IncrementalRemove(). Because always the second call
to Manage_subdevs() with 'r' operation will follow up.

This was what I meant, it was only related to the code I modified.

Thanks.

BTW, do you have any suggestion for the commit log? It seems current commit
message is not that clear, and I want to listen to your input :-)
