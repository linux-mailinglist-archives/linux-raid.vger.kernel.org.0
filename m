mdadm supports TRIM in the sense that it properly passes down TRIM of the
array to participant member devices, for them to do their own underlying
storage management operations. Even from the complex RAID levels such as RAID5
and RAID6. This is commendable and IIRC far from always was the case.

Stretching "TRIM support" to mean a hypothetical used-blocks-accounting
feature and use of that to speed-up rebuilds, is a surefire way to get
misunderstood in a conversation. As is saying "mdadm doesn't support TRIM"
only due to it not having that specific advanced feature.
