As the guy who looks after the wiki, none of my systems (to my best
knowledge) have or have had an mdadm.conf. There's supposed to be a way
to create it automagically from the current running config, but I've
never managed to get to grips with it ...

It's what happens when a system boots - as each drive is recognised,
it's added to an array until the array has enough drives to function. In
other words, rather than doing an mdadm assemble command with all the
drives, it's doing an assemble with just one drive at a time saying "add
to the relevant array".

If you've disabled auto-assemble, presumably you do need mdadm.conf to
tell mdadm what to assemble, which presumably also means you can't have
root on a raid because boot needs the array to find mdadm.conf in order
to start the array ... Don't quote me on that ...
