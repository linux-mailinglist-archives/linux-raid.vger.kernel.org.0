See below. There's no reason why it shouldn't work, PROVIDED nothing has 
happened to the mirror since you created it.

I dunno. A two-disk raid-5 is the same as a 2-disk mirror. That raid-5 
MAY just start and run and you'll be okay. You can try mounting it 
read-only and see what happens ...

If the conversion has overwritten the data, it will merely have 
overwritten one copy of the data with the other.

It might be a bit of a forensic job, but no I don't think so. Do you 
have that third 4TB HDD? If so, MAKE A BACKUP of one of the drives. That 
way, you'll have three copies to play with to try and recover the data.

As John says, please give us all the information you can. If you've just 
put a file system on top of the array, you should now have three copies 
of the filesystem to try and recover. I can't help any further here. but 
all you have to do is track down the start of said filesystem, work out 
where you tell linux to start a partition so it correctly contains the 
filesystem, and then mount said partition. Your data should all be there.

Actually, you might be better off not copying onto drive 3. If you can 
work out where your filesystem partition should start, create a 
partition on drive 3 and copy the filesystem contents into said partition.

I've cc'd a couple of people I hope can help, but basically, you need to 
find out where in the raid array your data has been put, and then work 
out how to access it. Your data SHOULD be recoverable, but you've got 
some detective work ahead of you.

Cheers,
Wol
