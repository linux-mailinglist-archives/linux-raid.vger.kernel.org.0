As you might have glanced from the documentation, this is one of the 
really bad mess-ups.
This particular feature was one of the first attempts by Intel to get 
software RAID to work with NVMe without having to change Windows.
What they did here was to 'hide' the NVMe device behind an AHCI device, 
essentially turning the AHCI PCI device into a combo with shared 
registers and shared interrupts.
The resulting NVMe device is in violation of the spec, making it 
questionable whether we should modify our implementation for a 
non-compliant device.
To make matters worse Intel has since come up with similar (but 
different) technologies; RSTe/VMD is one of the examples.
And Windows has meanwhile learned to handle NVMe, so the entire
rationale for this piece of .... has gone.
Making it even more questionable whether we should support it.

The only way I see how we could support it would be by writing an PCI 
driver which splits the AHCI driver into two PCI virtual functions, the
first being a 'normal' AHCI' device and the other one being the NVMe.
Not sure if that's possible, though (one possible would have to ask 
Bjorn Helgaas), but that seems to be the best option.
Except from ditching the NVMe in that device, of course :-)

Cheers,

Hannes
