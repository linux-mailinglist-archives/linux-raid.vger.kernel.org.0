Unlikely, but never say never ...

It doesn't seem to be crashing under load, it's more like getting stuck 
in idle, but I've debugged enough problems to know that it's rarely what 
you initially think it is.

The PSU is a 550W Corsair unit, so unless it's faulty power load 
certainly won't be an issue...

I'll need to do a lot of playing over Christmas, if I get the chance ...

Cheers,
Wol
