Hello Roger.

I just run atop on a different and much better hardware doing mdadm --grow=
 on raid5 with 4 drives and it shows the following

DSK | sdl | | busy 90% | read 950=C2=A0 | | write 502 | | KiB/r 1012 | KiB=

      bitmap: 8/59 pages [32KB], 131072KB chunk

Surprisingly all 4 drives show approximately 94MB/s read and 25MB/s write.=

Even when each of the drives can read 270MB/s and write 250MB/s, the sync =
speed is 100MB/s only, so?

Does --grow differ from --add?

Thanks,
Jaromir

So there are very few reads going on for sdd, but a lot of reads of the ot=
her disks to recalculate what the data on that disk.

This is on raid6, but if raid6 is not doing a pointless check read on a ne=
w disk add, I would not expect raid5 to be.


This is on a 5.14 kernel.

It does make sense, but have you read the code to see if it already does i=
t?



And if it doesn't, someone's going to have to write it, in which case it =


doesn't make sense, not to have that as the default.



Bear in mind that rebuilding the array with a new drive is completely 

different logic to doing an integrity check, so will need its own code, =


so I expect it already works that way.



I think you've got two choices. Firstly, raid or not, you should have 

backups! Raid is for high-availability, not for keeping your data safe! =


And secondly, go raid-6 which gives you that bit extra redundancy.
