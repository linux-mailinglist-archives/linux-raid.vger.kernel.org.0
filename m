Hello,

Mdadm is in use in openwrt without udev (thanks to Artur for research).
They are using hotplug scripts:
https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/base-system/hotplug#coldplug
To provide compatibility with libudev dependency they wrote small shim:
https://openwrt.org/packages/pkgdata/libudev-fbsd
Unfortunately, not all libudev functions are defined, mdadm compilation
there might be problematic:
https://openwrt.org/packages/pkgdata_lede17_1/mdadm

Now, it makes sense to define libudev as optional dependency.
It should be done before new release, Intel will do that.

Anyway, I still think that we should drop udev detection from mdadm.
I there is no systemd-udevd, we should expect other tool to provide
similar functionality, like hotplug scripts, eudev.
IMO mdadm doesn't need to create any link.

Mariusz
