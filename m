It is also controversial approach[1].

I think that the best we can do here is to warn user, for example:
"Please ensure that drive you used return zeros after discard."
We should ask for confirmation (it should be possible to skip with --run).
I would like to leave discard feature validation on user side, it is not mdadm
task. Simply, if you want to use it, then it is done on your own risk and
hopefully you know what you want to achieve.
That will simplify implementation on mdadm side. What do you think?

mdadm operates on 512B, so using 4K data regions could be destructive.
Also left shift causes that size value is increasing. We can't clear more that
user requested. We need to use 512b sectors as mdadm does.

I don't know how native raid0 size is passed and how zones are created but I
suspect that s->size may not be correct for all drives. It it a global property
but for zoned raid member size could be different. You need to check how it
applies.

Also, I'm not sure if this feature is needed for raid0, because there is no
resync. Maybe we can exclude raid0 from discard?

In my convention, all shape attributes should be set in mdadm.c, later they
should be considered as const, we should not overwrite them. This structure
represents user settings.
This is why I consider updating assume_clean in Create.c as wrong. When discard
is set then we are assuming that user want to skip resync too, otherwise it
doesn't have sense. Also, if discard of any drive fails we are returning error
and create operation will fail anyway.

I would expected something like: "Discard requested, setting --assume-clean to
skip resync".
Also, will be great if you can add some tests, at least for command-line.
