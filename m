It never happens on kernel 5.11 series, and always happens after 5.12-rc1 and persists through 5.18.0. There's a new mix of behaviors with 5.19, I suspect the mm improvements in this series might be masking the problem.

These VMs are each in their own cgroup. As the problem begins, I see increasing IO pressure, and decreasing IO, for each qemu instance's cgroup, and the cgroups for httpd, journald, auditd, and postgresql. IO pressure goes to nearly ~99% and IO is literally 0.

The failure is very early on such that the UUID for the root file system isn't found, but not much to go on as to why.[3] I have tested the first and last skipped commits in the bisect log below, they successfully boot a VM but not the hardware.

I looked at the traces, btrfs is stuck waiting on IO and blk tags, which means
we've got a lot of outstanding requests and are waiting for them to finish so we
can allocate more requests.

Additionally I'm seeing a bunch of the blkg async submit things, which are used
when we have the block cgroup stuff turned on and compression enabled, so we
punt any compressed bios to a per-cgroup async thread to submit the IO's in the
appropriate block cgroup context.

This could mean we're just being overly mean and generating too many IO's, but
since the IO goes to 0 I'm more inclined to believe there's a screw up in
whatever IO cgroup controller you're using.

To help narrow this down can you disable any IO controller you've got enabled
and see if you can reproduce?  If you can sysrq+w is super helpful as it'll
point us in the next direction to look.  Thanks,

Josef
