Subject: [PATCH v3] Export MDRAID bitmap on disk structure in UAPI header file
Date: Thu,  6 Feb 2025 23:30:05 +0100

When working on software that manages MD RAID disks from
userspace. Currently provided headers only contain MD superblock.
That is not enough to fully populate MD RAID metadata.
Therefore this patch adds bitmap superblock as well.

V1 -> V2: Also exported stuff needed by mdadm according to Mariusz Tkaczyk
V2 -> V3: Fixed checkpatch errors
