but we do not know if the drive is completly empty and would bypass a 
direct compare of A versus B without null it

where did i say that?

you came over the same way as i asked why don't work "write-mostly" for 
RAID10 while it does for RAID1 when you want to mix SSD/HDD

and you even came up the first posts like you are a developer while you 
are just a ordianry user like me

look for opportunities in your own threads about that opportunities and 
not in questions about state of play

but that is NOT the topic of a question "What DOES TRIM/discard in RAID do"

DOES versus COULD DO

> Whether it's worth the effort is a different question ... :-)

it's an important question because someone has a) to do the work b) god 
beware of errors in that context and c) the world is not SSD only

the topic was "oes it only pass-through TRIM/discard information to the 
underlying devices or can it also store information about which blocks 
contain valid data in the superblock metadata"

if you want to discuss something else for the sake of god start your own 
thread and leave me in peace
