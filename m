Hi All,

This is not a fix, it just reduces race probability because file descriptor
will be opened later. I normal environment issue is not likely to happen
because user doesn't create and stop arrays in loop. Issue here
should be resolved in tests, perhaps wait should be sufficient.

I tried to resolve it in the past by adding completion to md driver and force
mdadm --stop command to wait for sysfs clean up but I have never finished it.
IMO it is a better way, wait for device to be fully removed by MD during stop.
Thoughts?

One objection I have here is that error handling is changed, so it could be
harmful change for users.

I'm slowly working on this. The change is not simple, starting from terrible
create_mddev code and char *mddev and char *name rules , ending with hidden
references which we are not aware off (it is common to create temp node and
open mddevice in mdadm) and other references in systemd (because of that, udev
is avoiding to open device).
This also indicate that we should drop partition discover in kernel and use
udev in the future, especially for external metadata (where RO -> RW transition
happens during assembly). But this is a separate problem.
