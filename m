Just to provide closure to the system instability I reported four
months ago.  End of 2021 I replaced the motherboard, CPU, & RAM with
"server grade" hardware (intel xeon).  Ever since upgrading hardware,
the system has been 100% stable.  Even during sustained mdadm I/O
workloads, etc.

So it appears the consumer grade motherboard was at fault all along.
Thanks for the help troubleshooting the issue.
