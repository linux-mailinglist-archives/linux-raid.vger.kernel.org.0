Ouch, this is not good.  But you have RAID6, so it should be ok...

What are you comparing the checksums too?  Just because you assemble
drives 1 and 2 and read the filesystem, then assemble drives 3 and 4
into another array, how do you know which checksum is correct if they
differ?

I'm not sure this is really going to work how you think....

This is not un-expected.  You already have md127 setup using the same
UUID, and mdadm is doing the right thing to refuse to assemble a
different array name with the same underlying UUID.  

But if you have four drives, you've got four sets of checksums to
calculate for each file, which is going to take time.  And I think
just doing it one pair of disks at a time is the safest way.  Your
data is important to you, obviously, but how much is it worth?  

Can you afford to get some replacement disks, or even just a single
large disk and them dump all your files onto a new single disk to try
and save what you have, even if it's corrupted?

And for good reason.  You might be able to do an overlayfs on each
pair, then go in and change the UUID of the second pair to something
different, and then start the array with a new name and disk member
UUIDs.  

But it's alot of hacking for probably not much payout.

Have you found a file with corruption?  If so, have you done a quick
test where you do the four pairs of the array assembled and checked
just that one single file to see if the checksum differs?  

And again, if it does differ, how do you decide what is the correct
data?  

I would strongly suspect that the data is corrupted no matter what.  

In any case, good luck!  Maybe the raid6check tool will help, but I'd
rather try to at least use your most recent backup as a check.
