Thanks for your feedback!

Agreed that an ioctl is preferable over a sysctl interface. I wasn't aware
of securityfs and prefer it over a /dev/mapper/control ioctl. Ultimately
the list of digests is meaningful to LoadPin, not (directly) to the device
mapper / verity. I'm not sure how well this feature of integrating LoadPin
with verity will be by the verity maintainers in the first place, it's
probably best to limit the LoadPin specific stuff in verity to a minimum.
I experimented a bit with the securityfs option, building it doesn't seem
too much of an overhead. If loadpin.c ends up too cluttered with the
verity and securityfs stuff I could try to outsource some of it to (a)
dedicated file(s).
