Yes, that how it was in the past, and I would like to change it because 
tests directory is too big and we are still adding new tests.

Ideally, tests like that should stay with kernel, because repository you are
contributing now is "mdadm" - userspace application to manage md devices, not
the driver itself.
That is why I wanted to highlight that placement is controversial but I'm fine
with that. As you said, we did that in the past.

Song, what do you think? Where we should put the test like in the future?

Please add it in comment above the value.
