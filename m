Thanks for the suggestions.
No partition ever on these disks.
I will try the dd method but as there was never a partition on the drive 
I don't think that will return results.
The busy drive is not part of an active md array nor mounted so still a 
bit bemused by that.
I know the order, after my first few muckups I number them to make sure 
if I have to move them it will work. If I use assume clean, if it does 
not work I can just try another order I assume. I do have a backup but 
14T will take time to replicate.
