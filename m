Do you have an mdadm.conf, or do the arrays auto-assemble without one?

Your raid shouldn't be named md0 (md1) at all. By default they now count 
down from md127 (I think ...)

If you're going to give it a name, give it a name like "root", or 
"data", or "home". But I've found that very tricky post-facto - it's 
best done when the array is first created.

Old host, new host ...

Sounds to me like the best way to move the raid would simply be to 
transfer the disks across. The new system should just recognise the 
array. If it doesn't you can just put the disks back in the old system.

What I would NOT do is put the old disks in the new system and then 
build it. Make sure the new system is up and running before you move the 
disks across. (There have been reports of 
installers/updates/stuff-like-that not recognising raids and trashing them.)

Dunno where you looked on-line, but this is the best place. Any 
improvements you think of, let me know.

Cheers,
