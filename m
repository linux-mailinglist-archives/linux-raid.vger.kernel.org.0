I searched by your email in my email box and I didn't find emails from 
you at earlier this year. Is there a link? Discard request is usually 
very big.
If the discard request is not chunk aligned, raid10 can handle this 
problem without my patch. It splits I/O by chunk size and write/discard
this chunk to all copies.

4x32gb means 4 disks and each disk is 32GB?
For the discard time problem, as mentioned just now, it splits big 
discard request into small chunks. So it takes very long time.
My patch resolves this problem.

It's a raid456 problem, not raid10.
