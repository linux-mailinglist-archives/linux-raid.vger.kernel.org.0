Perhaps replacing that drive should be a good idea, then. Also - don't mdad=
m --replace it - better --fail, --remove and --add. Otherwise, md might jus=
t replicate the badblock list unless you turn the shite off first. ZFS hand=
les this far better, that's true, but I chose to go back to md since zfs is=
n't really very flexible.
