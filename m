Then why do some linux block devices THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH 
HARDWARE support trim? (Sorry I can't name them, I've come across them).

And are you telling me that you're happy with a block device trashing 
your live data because the filesystem or whatever trimmed it? If the 
file system sends a TRIM command, it's saying "I am no longer using this 
space". What the underlying block layer does with it is up that layer. 
An SSD might use it for wear leveling, I'm pretty certain 
thin-provisioning uses it to release space (oh there's my block layer 
that isn't hardware).

AND THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO REASON why md-raid shouldn't flag it as "this 
doesn't need recovery". Okay, it would need some sort of bitmap to say 
"these stripes are/aren't in use, which would chew up some disk space, 
but it's perfectly feasible.

Cheers,
Wol
