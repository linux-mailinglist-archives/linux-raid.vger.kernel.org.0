Yes, that's true for RAID456. RAID456 is issuing 4k size requests to =
lower backing
device, no matter how large the request received is. That's won't be a =

because for normal read and write operations, those 4k size requests can =

complaining about unacceptable performance of raid456.

I'm quite aware that it is raid456 that is breaking the requests. It =
might be
better if we can avoid this in raid456. I believe it can be very =
difficult due to the
design of raid456 code. However, the question now is the merging is =
successful for
normal read/write operations, but failed for discard operations. Where =
lies the=20
difference? I did some testing in a qemu vm and added some debug =
printing in the
control flow. By what I have discovered, I'm quite confident that the =
discard
requests are not processed the right way when merging them.
