% This is my mantra as well here.  For my home system, I prefer
% symplicity and robustness and performance, so I tend just use RAID1

I've finally convinced The Boss to spring for additional disks so that I
can mirror, so our two servers both have SSD mirroring; yay.  The web
server doesn't need much space, so it has a pair of 4T HDDs mirrored as
well ... but as RAID10 since I thought that that was cool.  Ah, well.


% mirrors of all my disks.  I really don't have all that much stuff I
% need lots of disk space for.  And for that I have a scratch volume.  
[snip]

Heh.  Not only do we have scratch space on diskfarm, but that's where
we have 30T-plus of data that continues to grow with every video made.
Mirroring just won't do there, both because I'd have to have little
chunks of mirror and because I don't know that I can convince her to pay
for THAT much storage (plus plugging in all of those drives).  We need
RAID5 there ... but the devices are just really frickin' huge.


Thanks & HANN
