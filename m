Hi Jes,
Sorry for the delay. We found one grow related problem and needed to determine
if it is the patchset related. It seems not, so for all patches:

Reviewed-by: Mariusz Tkaczyk <mariusz.tkaczyk@linux.intel.com>

Thanks to Neil we can revert "revert of Remove KillMode" patch (hopefully)
forever this time. Please apply those paches, then I will send a revert.

Thanks,
Mariusz
