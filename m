That's called paranoia - ALL drives have hiccups when there's absolutely 
nothing wrong with them. What are the manufacturer's error figures? 
Expect at least one error every two or three complete passes of pretty 
much every large big disk nowadays?

What's the point of having thousands of spare sectors, if you chuck the 
drive in the trash at the first hint of trouble?
