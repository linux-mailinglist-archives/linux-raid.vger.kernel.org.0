Dear Song, Paul, and other Linux-RAID kernel management members,

Thank you so much for your detailed reply and we apologize for our
delayed response. We faced uncertainty in school reopening in China,
as till this day the Tsinghua campus is not open, making full testing
and debugging hard (which requires physical access to our testbed).
Meanwhile, we can make plans to clean up the code and set up the mdadm
test as Song suggested.

Yes, the major advantage our module offers is performance, targeting
larger all-flash arrays increasingly common today. Its main source of
improvement comes from shortened/simpler write path, real-time
light-weight SSD performance spike detection, and RAID declustering.
As a result, it improves median write latency by up to several times,
and tail latency by nearly 400 times compared to existing RAID5 with
md, on multiple storage traces and YCSB running on RocksDB. The
declustering part of our work can be found in our FAST 2018 paper:
https://www.usenix.org/node/210543.

As to the other questions:
(2)  What's the impact on existing users? and (3) Can we improve
existing code to achieve the same benefit?
Their answers are related. As our module is targeting larger RAID
pools, such as SSD enclosures of 20 or more drives, to modify existing
md would not deliver benefits to small array users (for sizes like 7+1
RAID5). The code base is close to 5000 lines in C and we believe it
would work better as an alternative module which can be used by larger
arrays. Its internal workings are entirely transparent, with no new
user interfaces.

If the university opens by the end of May, we will target mid-late
June to finish basic testing and cleaning, and then release our code
for your review by a private github repo. Is that acceptable?

Best regards,

Xiaosong, Tianyang, Guangyan, and Junyu
