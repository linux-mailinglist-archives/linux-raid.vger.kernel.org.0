Hi Jes,
We have around 40 to 50 patches waiting. We are also waiting for official
4.2 release (it was proposed by me in Jan'21 but it was initially mentioned in
Jul'20!). My preposition for stable release plan was also ignored[1].
I understand that you are busy and mdadm is not in your mind right now.

Coly comes with offer to take care of mdadm, could you answer?
Current model doesn't work, we definitely need to find new solution.
If there any other folk interested in this position, please
speak up loudly!

I will be pleased to cooperate with Coly, or any other maintainer which is
active and responsible. Naturally, VROC team will give support,
especially with external management issues.

It is a time to change something, we shouldn't wait more.

Thanks,
Mariusz
