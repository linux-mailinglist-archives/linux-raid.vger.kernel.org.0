Then please be explicit when sending out a pull request like this on why
it's late. Otherwise it just looks like a normal pull request, which it
is not. If your original pull request had any kind of explanation on why
so much is being sent so late, then we would not be having this followup
at all...

Most of the time Linus will be explicit about _maybe_ doing an -rc8, but
it doesn't really change the rule that I should have bigger stuff in the
week between rc6 and rc7. When -rc7 is cut, my for-next branches should
be basically baked and done at that point, and then post -rc7 just fixes
for existing code. If people stick to that rc6-7 timing, then it'll
always work, regardless of an -rc8 happening or not.

Even when Linus has -rc8 musings in his later rc posts, it's not a given
that they will happen.

I've done a for-6.5/block-late and put your stuff there, but it can be
dropped very easily. It doesn't really matter if Christoph's stuff can
get pushed, it's still a lot of commits late. So regardless of that, the
only real difference with a new PR would be that we'd drop some bits.
It'd still go into a late branch, as it is indeed late.
