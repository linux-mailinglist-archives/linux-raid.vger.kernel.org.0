Does that mean you have three drives currently?

Very. mdadm --add ...

Okay, buy your new 8TB drives in pairs (unless you've got a bunch of 
scratch 4TB drives).

Assuming you've got a 3x4TB array this will get you to a 3x8TB in one hit...

mdadm --replace 4TB with 8TB
Twice.

mdadm --create --level=striped 4TB 4TB (to give you an 8TB raid0)

mdadm --replace 4TB with 8TB raid0 mirror

You may then be able move the data off your scratch drives onto the 
array, create another 8TB raid0, and add that for a raid6. You can then 
just add 8TB drives bit by bit.

Read the website - there#s a lot of info there...
