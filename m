I don't see how the comment below relates to this at all. This 4k has
nothing to do with anything related to the array, it wos only a
convenient size to read and check the result. But per Martin's points,
this code will go away in v3 seeing it's more appropriate to use
WRITE_ZEROS and that interface guarantees that there will be zeros, thus
no need to check.

I think the better approach is to just use WRITE_ZEROS.

I don't really follow this.

I'll check raid0 size. If possible I'd rather not have the restriction
to avoid raid0 as it becomes complicated and users may have reason to
zero besides avoiding resync.

The v2 version of this patch did not modify the shape attributes in
Create.c; that was only in v1.

Ok.
