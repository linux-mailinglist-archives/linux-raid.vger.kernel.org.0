Yes, from kernel side, we think after succeed stop_array ioct, the
kernel disk should be removed in the end. We used to call del_gendisk
asynchronously, leaves a race window that sysfs entries still visible
to user.

We decide to fix this in the last merge window, however, it's true mdadm
has to be fixed together.

Idealy, we should fix mdadm first, then after a release, fix kernel.
Sadly the transition stage is missing now. :(

If we want to just avoid this problem in kernel, what I can think of is
adding a switch and mark it deprecated for now. And in new mdadm
releases enable that switch, and after sometime, remove mdadm legacy
code to stop array, and finally remove the deprecated switch in kernel
then everyone will be happy :)
